That sounds like an awesome project—compact, functional, and a fun way to blend software with hardware! You’ve already nailed the essentials:

### Here’s a rough plan to bring it to life:

#### 1. **Web App on the Raspberry Pi**

- Use **Flask** or **FastAPI** (Python-based) to build a simple interface.
    
- Host it locally using Nginx or just run it directly via Python.
    
- Optionally, add some authentication or restrict access to your local network.
    

#### 2. **LED Control**

- Use **WS2812B (NeoPixel)** or **APA102** RGB LEDs – they’re addressable and easy to control via GPIO.
    
- Control with the **`rpi_ws281x`** library or **`gpiozero`**, depending on the LEDs.
    

#### 3. **Battery Power**

- Since you don’t have a socket nearby:
    
    - Use a **USB power bank** to power both the Pi and the LEDs.
        
    - OR power the Pi separately and use a **battery pack** just for the LEDs (e.g., 18650 Li-ion batteries with a voltage regulator to match LED specs).
        
    - Keep in mind current draw: RGB LEDs can eat a lot of juice when all colors are full-on white.
        

#### 4. **Communication**

- Either:
    
    - Direct GPIO connection from Pi to LEDs.
        
    - Or use a microcontroller like an **ESP32** to handle the LEDs, and your Pi sends commands over Wi-Fi (MQTT or REST API). This is useful if the Pi and LEDs are far apart.

### Optional Features:

- Save lighting presets in your web app.
    
- Add auto-on/off with a timer or based on ambient light.
    
- Mobile-friendly interface so you can control it from your phone.
    

How do you feel about using GPIO directly vs having something like an ESP32 as a controller? Want to keep it all wired or go semi-wireless with the LED control?
