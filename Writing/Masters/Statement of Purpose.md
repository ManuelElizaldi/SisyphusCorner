# Areas of Interest 
Health Informatics is the foundation of what I want to learn at the MSIS program. I want to perfect my knowledge in how IT can be used to improve healthcare delivery. I have worked in the financial and clinic operations side of this industry as a Business Intelligence Developer but the more I explore this field the more curious I am about using EHR and patient records to build systems that can help providers take better clinical decisions. I want to use information to improve health. From my perspective, there's always going to be room for improvement, specifically because I have never had formal training in health informatics. So taking this into account I want to take classes that teach me more about this subject. 

Another area of interest is the relationships between human and computers. We interact with computers every day, but this relationship will only get closer and closer. This is even more prevalent with AI, people use these models to ask them about a plethora of subjects, including personal inquiries. Computers are used in every job, so understanding how we use them will give me knowledge to design digitally ergonomic systems that can best serve us. Understanding usability will give me the knowledge necessary to ensure our systems are adopted seamlessly. 

The more natural a digital system feels, the easier its adoption. 

A new relationship has emerged in recent years, and that's the relationship between humans and AI. The systems I want to build to help providers in hospitals demand high stakes ethical responsibilities. It is very important to understand how can we use AI for the improvement of everybody. Partnership between AI and humans.  

But behind all of these systems, there's a vast amount of information, I once heard from a manager at my job when I was a data analyst and he said that we are only as powerful as long as our data is clean and organized. I don't have the experience of managing a database, that's why I want to take classes regarding this subject, I have only been on the extraction side of projects. Also a clinic/hospital will not only produce tabular data, there's images, text and many other data types. Having solid knowledge of NoSQL databases is important as well as how best we can store all of this information in order for an AI to read it, use it and provide clinical guidance to providers. AI will be very important to help us parse the millions of rows of data that a clinic or hospital can produce. 

But this information needs to be findable and readable, organization is key. That is why I am interested in information architecture and design. 

# Career background 
Since the beginning of my career I have worked with information. I studied my bachelor's in economics  in Anahuac University in Mexico City. There I was trained to work with data to build economic and statistical models. This laid the foundation for a career in data analysis. After graduating I took a coding boot camp at University of Texas, taking advantage of the time I had after a covid layoff. This had its reward with my job in Austin, Texas, as a Data Analyst for a Start up that used call center data to perform speech analysis and determine where customer frustrations happened. This way we could give insights into how companies could improve their product or services to better the user experience. I had variety of clients, each with its own data challenges which required flexibility and quick adaptability. Of course the foundation knowledge of working with data made me capable of this. Here I had my first experience with machine learning. This company was a start up, so it was required of me to wear different hats, working on product enhancement through user interaction data of our app. I also delved a little bit with API and deploying new features to our website. I also performed dashboards visualization. A very high demand environment where I had the opportunity to learn a lot of building high value systems. 

After this I had experience as an entrepreneur where I built the digital infrastructure to sell ethically sourced coffee from Mexico. This was my first exposure to cloud infrastructure, which inspired my decision to take on the Post Graduate Cloud Computing at University of Texas. 


I have had very rewarding experiences with this school
