# Draft Statement of Purpose: MSIS at UT Austin 
Early in my career as a data analyst, a manager shared his philosophy of work with me: "We are only as powerful as our data is clean." At the time, I was analyzing customer satisfaction in call center data to detect where people were encountering frustration. I quickly understood that information systems must be architected, managed, and designed for intuitive use in order to bring value. 

Today, working in the healthcare sector, I see the importance of that lesson amplified. In finance or retail, poor data management leads to lost revenue, but in healthcare, that noise can lead to fragmented care,
clinic mismanagement, patients not recovering and provider burnout.

I am applying to the Master of Science in Information Studies (MSIS) program at the University of Texas at Austin to integrate my technical background with human-centered design principles. 

My path to information studies has been defined by a constant desire to build more efficient systems. Following my Bachelor’s degree in Economics at Anahuac University, where I learned to build economic and statistical models, I sought to hone my technical skills in programming. This led me to the University of Texas at Austin for the first time, where I completed the Coding, Data Analysis and Visualization Boot-camp. This rigorous training allowed me to transition into a Data Analyst role for a startup. During this time I utilized machine learning to parse speech data and improve user experience for a plethora of clients from a range of different industries.

Later, after an economic shock that led to a layoff, I launched an ethically sourced Mexican coffee company. I realized that managing a business required more than selling a product and inventory lists. It needed digital infrastructure. I personally developed a Python based inventory management system integrating cloud infrastructure with Shopify APIs to automate shipping label creation. This experience demonstrated the power of the cloud and motivated me to return to UT for the Post Graduate Program in Cloud Computing.

These experiences equipped me with the knowledge to build digital infrastructure. However, to transition from a developer to a solutions architect, I need more than technical experience. I am seeking the MSIS to master the theoretical frameworks necessary to design systems that are not just functional, but ethically grounded and human-centered.

Currently, serving as a Business Intelligence Developer in the healthcare sector, I work at the intersection of data and operations. My daily tasks involve developing ETL pipelines to answer management questions, ensuring patients are scheduled for wellness visits and optimizing the complex credentialing and billing cycles required for insurance reimbursement. By witnessing the vast patient information flowing through our systems, I began to grow curious. While my work is vital for the company's operations, I wanted to expand the reach of my impact. I have seen how efficiently we leverage information for claims and credentialing, but now I am motivated to learn how to harness this data not just for administrative objectives, but to build the next generation of clinical care tools to impact patient outcomes. I want to transition from building pipelines that ensure payment to building systems that ensure health.

My objective is to master the information architecture necessary to ingest unstructured data from physician notes, images, and sensor outputs, and organizing it for retrieval by AI models. However, a system is only effective if it is adopted, and in healthcare, usability is a safety requirement. I aim to study how to create digitally ergonomic interfaces that transform massive datasets into clinical decision support systems for health providers

This drives my interest in these key areas at iSchool: Health Informatics, Human-Computer Interaction, Information Architecture and Design and AI Ethics. I want to move beyond data extraction and become an architect of information systems that enable a doctor-computer partnership. 

Returning to UT Austin is the natural next step in my trajectory. Having already completed two certificate programs with the university, I have experienced UT’s high quality technical instruction, which has been instrumental in enriching my career and empowering me to create tangible professional impact. I am now eager to join the iSchool’s community and rich intellectual ecosystem.

After 2 years in healthcare, I have found purpose in this industry and I am specifically drawn to Health Informatics. I aim to study under Dr. Ying Ding in the AI Health Lab, her work on AI in healthcare science aligns perfectly with my goal to transform raw Electronic Health Records into predictive clinical tools. Furthermore, acknowledging that healthcare technologies carry high stakes, I am deeply interested in Dr. Kenneth Fleischmann’s research on AI ethics. I want to learn how to govern these pipelines so they remain transparent and lenient with HIPAA regulation. Finally, the opportunity to study health informatics with Dr. Bo Xie would provide the theoretical grounding I need to ensure the systems I build are accessible and no patient if left behind. 

Post-graduation, I aim to step into the role of a Clinical AI Systems Architect. My ambition is to design the "digital nervous system" of the modern hospital, where data from IoT sensors and historical records lay the foundation for real-time predictive models. I term this concept the AI Augmented Provider Assistant System, an application where technology does not replace or interrupt the doctor, but amplifies their clinical knowledge.

Nonetheless, I recognize that the greatest barrier to this future is not Computational power, but trust. A sophisticated model is useless if a clinician cannot interpret its output. This challenge anchors my interest in Explainable AI (XAI). I need to master the ability to design architectures that provide not just a prediction, but the rationale behind it.


The MSIS at UT Austin is the essential crucible where I will merge my technical capabilities with this necessary design wisdom, preparing me to build the secure, transparent, and life-saving systems of tomorrow.

# Notes
## Areas of Interest 
Health Informatics is the foundation of what I want to learn at the MSIS program. I want to perfect my knowledge in how IT can be used to improve healthcare delivery. I have worked in the financial and clinic operations side of this industry as a Business Intelligence Developer but the more I explore this field the more curious I am about using EHR and patient records to build systems that can help providers take better clinical decisions. I want to use information to improve health. From my perspective, there's always going to be room for improvement, specifically because I have never had formal training in health informatics. So taking this into account I want to take classes that teach me more about this subject. 

Another area of interest is the relationships between human and computers. We interact with computers every day, but this relationship will only get closer and closer. This is even more prevalent with AI, people use these models to ask them about a plethora of subjects, including personal inquiries. Computers are used in every job, so understanding how we use them will give me knowledge to design digitally ergonomic systems that can best serve us. Understanding usability will give me the knowledge necessary to ensure our systems are adopted seamlessly. 

The more natural a digital system feels, the easier its adoption. Make it digitally ergonomic, making it as easily as possible to adopt and learn. Integration between technology and humans by understanding how humans think and interact with AI. 

A new relationship has emerged in recent years, and that's the relationship between humans and AI. The systems I want to build to help providers in hospitals demand high stakes ethical responsibilities. It is very important to understand how can we use AI for the improvement of everybody. Partnership between AI and humans.  

But behind all of these systems, there's a vast amount of information, I once heard from a manager at my job when I was a data analyst and he said that we are only as powerful as long as our data is clean and organized. I don't have the experience of managing a database, that's why I want to take classes regarding this subject, I have only been on the extraction side of projects. Also a clinic/hospital will not only produce tabular data, there's images, text and many other data types. Having solid knowledge of NoSQL databases is important as well as how best we can store all of this information in order for an AI to read it, use it and provide clinical guidance to providers. AI will be very important to help us parse the millions of rows of data that a clinic or hospital can produce. 

But this information needs to be findable and readable, organization is key. That is why I am interested in information architecture and design. 

## Career background 
Since the beginning of my career I have worked with information. I studied my bachelor's in economics  in Anahuac University in Mexico City. There I was trained to work with data to build economic and statistical models. This laid the foundation for a career in data analysis. After graduating I took a coding boot camp at University of Texas, taking advantage of the time I had after a covid layoff. This had its reward with my job in Austin, Texas, as a Data Analyst for a Start up that used call center data to perform speech analysis and determine where customer frustrations happened. This way we could give insights into how companies could improve their product or services to better the user experience. I had variety of clients, each with its own data challenges which required flexibility and quick adaptability. Of course the foundation knowledge of working with data made me capable of this. Here I had my first experience with machine learning. This company was a start up, so it was required of me to wear different hats, working on product enhancement through user interaction data of our app. I also delved a little bit with API and deploying new features to our website. I also performed dashboards visualization. A very high demand environment where I had the opportunity to learn a lot of building high value systems. 

After this I had experience as an entrepreneur where I built the digital infrastructure to sell ethically sourced coffee from Mexico. This was my first exposure to cloud infrastructure, which inspired my decision to take on the Post Graduate Cloud Computing at University of Texas. I have had very rewarding experiences with this school and the quality of the material and professors has been excellent, providing me with the necessary career skills to have a rewarding career. 

I am currently working at a healthcare company, building pipelines that ensure patients receive their wellness visit, helping with the credentialing process and providing management with the necessary information for them to take decisions. 

I have plenty of exposure to the healthcare industry but I still want to learn more. 

## Career objectives
I want to continue in this path. I am committed to a career in healthcare informatics because I have realized that by building good systems I can provide proper healthcare for patients. Also, the new AI technologies together with cloud infrastructure can allow us to bring AI health straight into the patients hospital room. 

I want to employ data engineering skills to use IoT devices to build databases that hold patient information that can then be used to feed it into an AI - with the necessary ethical and governances considerations - and use that tool to provide providers with a system they can use to expand their knowledge base. This system can act as an extension of the healthprovider, the objective is not to remove the doctor or nurse from the equation, but to give them more tools to give better health care
