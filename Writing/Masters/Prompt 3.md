AI + Cloud + IOT devices in hospitals 
Title Clinical AI Systems Architect 

working directly with hospitals to improve care through the use of technology and AI 
It's partnership with UT AI Health 
**The title is Clinical AI systems Architect -> dedicated in understanding the vast amount of data generated by hospital rooms, cleaning 

Why this program -> AI Health + Database management + Human centered data science 

. As technology evolves, I envision a future where the patinet bedside functions as an --- continuously streaming vital information into a secure cloud fabric 

## My ideas:
Five years from now, I see hospital rooms evolving from care units into a crucial stage for data ingestion. Leveraging the multiple scanners used to track vital signs we can create a data pipeline that continuously stream information into a secure cloud server. This is where I see my future: as a Clinical AI Systems Architect. My goal is to build the infrastructure that captures this massive amount of patient data and funnels it into robust AI model capable of predictive analysis. With this, we can build a tool that enabled the partnership between AI and health providers to give a better care for patients. 

Of course, a system as complicated as this will require rigorous ethical guardrails to ensure that patient privacy and careful design to 
algorithmic decisions remain transparent to the clinicians who rely on them.


, architectural mastery and a deep knowledge of how to build a system that providers can trust. The classes like human computers relationships are a key part of this facilitating the adoption of this new tool. 



ensuring that all data from simple patient logs to complex waveform readings is organized, trustworthy, and protected by the highest standards of digital security.


This will  This program’s unique curriculum is the bridge between my technical foundation and the ethical, architectural mastery required to engineer these next-generation clinical ecosystems.
