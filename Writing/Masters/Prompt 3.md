AI + Cloud + IOT devices in hospitals 
Position -> Clinical AI Systems Architect

## Intro
As technology evolves and IoT and Edge Devices improve, I envision hospitals leveraging these technologies to transform hospital rooms into a source of massive amounts of data. In 5 years I would like to be at the forefront of this as a Clinical AI Systems Architect. Within each hospital room lies a huge potential to combine medical medical devices with AI and data processing technologies. 


However the velocity and size of this data can overwhelm traditional on premise centralized infrastructure, which and lead to latency that can cost a patients life. To counter this, Edge computing combined with a resilient cloud computing 

## My ideas:

Patients in hospitals are surrounded by devices gathering information. Leveraging my knowledge in healthcare information and leveraging the skills gained in data engineering and information archival from the MSIS program combined with my knowledge of cloud computing, edge devices in hospitals can be used to gather information about patient care. With the millions of information gathered from each patient we can deploy AI models trained specifically for healthcare combined with the skills and knowledge of healthcare providers an ethical system can be built to increase the care given to patients. 

his can be stored in a cloud storage where we can then deploy an AI model to analyse and help health providers nurture patients to health. 
With the power of IoT and Cloud backed with AI, healthcare can improve. 
Likewise, we can track if the care that is given provided is actually helping. 

We are surrounded by devices, each gathering information about how we live. In the future this will be more prevalent.

In 5 years, I envision myself as a Clinical AI Systems Architect. This role will take advantage of the improvements of IoT and Edge Devices. Hospital rooms will transform into a place that is generating big amounts of data. 


 There is a great potential to combine high-fidelity diagnostic scanners and continuous vital signs monitors with intelligent data processing technologies. This transformation is driven by the fact that every device at the patient’s bedside—from infusion pumps to continuous blood pressure cuffs—is generating millions of granular data points daily. This continuous, high-volume data is the foundation of true proactive care. Leveraging my experience with Cloud Computing and my interest in IoT devices, I see an immense opportunity to construct secure and intelligent systems for patient benefit.

However, the sheer velocity and heterogeneity of this data threaten to overwhelm centralized infrastructure, introducing latency that could cost minutes—and lives—in a time-sensitive emergency. To counter this, **Edge Computing** is paramount. By deploying lightweight processing directly at the hospital network edge, we perform immediate data triage, ensuring that only necessary, high-quality information is aggregated into the cloud fabric. This allows for instantaneous, preventative feedback—such as calculating a rapid deterioration score—to be placed immediately at the providers’ fingertips, preventing risk situations before they escalate and fundamentally ensuring the patient's healing process is improved and closely monitored.
