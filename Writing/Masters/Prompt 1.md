#### Some Ideas
My journey to Information Studies began with a revelation. Volunteering with the Red Cross in Mexico ignited my desire to serve people, but one semester of medical school was enough to make me realize, this was not my vocation. I transferred to Economics, discovering that I could provide help not through physiology, but through the power of information. 

Economic shocks that led to two layoffs, forged my technical resilience. I returned to the University of Texas for a coding bootcamp, honing my skills for data analysis. 

My professional journey from building digital infrastructure for my own ethically sourced coffee startup to my current role as a Business Intelligence Developer has been defined by adaptability. Currently, I design data pipelines not just to track metrics, but to ensure patients receive critical wellness visits.


This philosophy now drives my work as a Healthcare Business Intelligence Developer. By building data pipelines that identify gaps in patient scheduling, I ensure thousands of individuals receive necessary wellness visits. I have finally circled back to my original goal of helping people, but my tools are now Python and SQL rather than a stethoscope.

Furthermore, my diverse work experience has taught me that data is never neutral. This drives my desire to contribute to the **Good Systems** initiative under **Dr. Ken Fleischmann**. I want to use my time at UT Austin to research how we can build AI architectures that are not only efficient but ethically robust. I am eager to join the iSchool community, transforming my technical skills into tools that ensure no patient is left behind by the digital revolution.

### Draft
My application details a progression from Medicine to Economics to Data Science, but it leaves out the critical realization that connects them: my vocation is not to practice medicine, but to engineer the systems that make medicine work. Leaving medical school was a pivot from treating individuals to addressing the infrastructure of care. My time as a Research Assistant in Economics confirmed this; I found more purpose in structuring the databases that held the truth than in building the theoretical models that predicted it.

My unique potential to succeed in the MSIS program lies in this "builder's mindset" paired with deep patient empathy. I am not just a coder; I am a pragmatist who has built e-commerce platforms from scratch and designed data pipelines for healthcare wellness visits. I possess the technical adaptability to navigate complex datasets—from call center analytics to patient effort scores—and the interdisciplinary grounding to understand the human behavior behind that data.

At UT Austin, I will not simply consume the curriculum; I will synthesize it. I plan to specialize in **Health Informatics**, bridging the gap between my technical skills and clinical outcomes. I am specifically eager to contribute to the **AI Health Lab** , offering my background in data engineering to support **Dr. Ying Ding’s** research on generative AI in healthcare. Additionally, I aim to ground my technical work in the ethical frameworks of the **Good Systems** grand challenge, learning from **Dr. Ken Fleischmann** to ensure that the patient scheduling systems of the future prioritize human well-being over algorithmic efficiency.

### What makes me unique
I started studying medicine because I had the opportunity to volunteer during high school at the red cross in my home town and I found purpose helping people. After one semester of medical school I realized this was not my vocation. I then realized that there were other ways of helping people and transferred to economics. I was attracted to this degree for its historical, physiological and even philosophical nature, alongside my passion for maths. Because I was a student with a scholarship I had to work for the university as a research assistant. I particularly enjoyed reading economic research papers and piecing together our database were we stored the necessary information for our research. The coding and organizing of information was more entertaining to me than the model building aspect 

After the I graduated and faced covid layoff I had to move back to my home town and had time to study in subjects I enjoyed, data analysis, data visualization, python, sql, etc. at a University of Texas coding bootcamp. This led me to get a job at Austin to do data analysis that used data from call centers to perform speech analytics and provide clients with information on how to improve client satisfaction. The clients were varied and each data set was different, which required adaptability and interdisciplinary knowledge. I had clients from landscaping, insurance, banking, tech, etc. Also, since this was a start up I had the opportunity to help in different areas of the company, product development, sales, app development, app maintenance, data visualizations, machine learning models, etc. 

After 2023 came I got laid off again and spent a year looking for a new job. Here I realized that I wanted to continue working in coding and computer. I started a small company selling ethically sourced coffee from Mexico and built all of the digital infrastructure to sale this product. I designed and built a small e commerce website and the stock tracking software to know how many coffee and merchandise we had left. 

After I finally found a job, which I got by building a personal trainer app built using my smartwatch data to build effort score models and a data pipeline I wrote a series of blog posts that captured the attention of a head hunter. I got an offer to work as a Business Intelligence Developer for a healthcare company where I have built programs to increase the amount of patient visits, ensure we reach the goal of wellness visits each month and a scheduling system to ensure the markets can contact the patients that haven't had their wellness visit. I have kept the patients in mind with each project I have worked on. 

I still work on writing coding articles and I am a proponent of AI and robots 

#### Safe keeping:
My journey to Information Studies began with a revelation. Volunteering with the Red Cross in Mexico ignited my desire to serve people, but one semester of medical school was enough to make me realize, this was not my vocation. I transferred to Economics, discovering that I could provide help not through physiology, but through the power of information. 

Economic shocks that led to two layoffs, forged my technical resilience. I returned to the University of Texas for a coding bootcamp, honing my skills for data analysis. 


My career has since demanded radical adaptability. When I founded a small coffee business, I didn't just sell a product, guided by the principles of conscious capitalism, I built my own inventory tracking software to ensure our ethical supply chain was transparent and efficient.

This philosophy now drives my work as a Healthcare Business Intelligence Developer. By building data pipelines that identify gaps in patient scheduling, I ensure thousands of individuals receive necessary wellness visits. I have finally circled back to my original goal of helping people, but my tools are now Python and SQL rather than a stethoscope.

I view the MSIS program as the theoretical capstone to my practical experience. I am eager to learn from people like **Dr. Yan Zhang** because her research in consumer health informatics will help me understand the human behavior behind the data, ensuring the systems I build bridge the gap between technical efficiency and patient well-being.
