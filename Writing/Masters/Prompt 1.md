My journey into informatics started with a realization. After volunteering in the Red Cross In Mexico, I found purpose in helping others. This led me to study medicine for a semester, but I soon realized this was not my vocation. I transferred to economics and found out that  impact human/people outcomes more effectively through _information systems_ than clinical practice. My unique potential to succeed in the MSIS program lies in this distinct interdisciplinary profile. I possess the "people-first" empathy of a former medical student and the technical grit of a self-taught data engineer.

My professional journey—from building digital infrastructure for my own ethically sourced coffee startup to my current role as a Business Intelligence Developer—has been defined by adaptability. Currently, I design data pipelines not just to track metrics, but to ensure patients receive critical wellness visits. I aim to bring this practical, patient-centric engineering experience to **Dr. Ying Ding’s AI Health Lab**. I see a direct application for my skills in her work on **precision medicine**, helping to transform complex medical datasets into actionable insights for the healthcare community.

Furthermore, my diverse work experience has taught me that data is never neutral. This drives my desire to contribute to the **Good Systems** initiative under **Dr. Ken Fleischmann**. I want to use my time at UT Austin to research how we can build AI architectures that are not only efficient but ethically robust. I am eager to join the iSchool community, transforming my technical skills into tools that ensure no patient is left behind by the digital revolution
