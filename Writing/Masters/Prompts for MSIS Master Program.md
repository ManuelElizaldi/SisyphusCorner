AI + Cloud + IOT devices in hospitals 

Patients in hospitals are surrounded by devices gathering information. This can be stored in a cloud storage where we can then deploy an AI model to analyse and help health providers nurture patients to health. 
With the power of IoT and Cloud backed with AI, healthcare can improve. 
Likewise, we can track if the care that is given provided is actually helping. 

We are surrounded by devices, each gathering information about how we live.

# Statement of Purpose 
During my high-school years while volunteering at the Red Cross in my hometown, I experienced the inefficiencies of the healthcare system in Mexico. This experience left me with a deep sense of purpose to help people in need and I started my degree in medicine. To my surprise the rigorous biology and histology classes where too much for me and I opted to change my degree to economics, another field where I believe I could help people. 

During my studies, I realized that most of the economic issues comes down to information. Having the right information can empower communities to take better economic decisions. After participating in research studies to apply effective policy in Mexico, I discovered a passion data analysis. 

Life brought me back to the healthcare industry working as a Business Intelligence Developer and I have been able to have an impact
