I am applying to the MSIS program in University of Texas at Austin. I am being asked to write an essay (200 - 300 words) asking me this:
Please address any information that you believe your application would be incomplete without and that sheds more light on your unique potential to succeed in the Master of Science Information Studies program and contribute to the university community and the field or profession.

My journey into informatics started with a revelation. After volunteering in the Red Cross In Mexico, I found purpose in helping others. This led me to study Medicine for a semester, but I soon realized this was not my vocation. I then transferred to Economics and discovered that I could impact people's outcomes more effectively through the power of information than clinical practice. This has led me to view code as a direct instrument of care. 

My professional resilience was forged through two layoffs. One during Covid, where I took this as an opportunity to join a coding Bootcamp at University of Texas. Then during the 2023 tech downturn, I did not wait for a new opportunity, I launched an ethically sourced coffee company, where I architected its full digital infrastructure.I believe these experiences give me the self directed learning style necessary to navigate the iSchool’s highly flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum.

Currently, I design data pipelines not just to track metrics, but to ensure patients receive yearly wellness visits. Viewing code as a direct instrument of care.




I am eager to join the iSchool community, transforming my technical skills into tools that ensure no patient is left behind by the digital revolution. 


#### Draft 

I aim to bring this practical, patient centric experience to Ying Ding’s AI Health Lab.  Based on my experience I see direct application for my skills in her work on precision medicine, using AI and ML to transform complex medical datasets into actionable insights for the healthcare community.

Furthermore, my work experience has taught me that technology is never neutral. 
This motivates my desire to contribute to the Good Systems initiative under Dr. Ken Fleischmann. I want to use my time at UT Austin to research how we can build AI architectures that are not only efficient but ethically robust. 


Finally, I will contribute to the university community by translating my industry experience into peer mentorship. I plan to organize "Technical Resilience" workshops for the **Student Association (SASI)**, helping peers leverage data engineering skills to navigate a volatile job market. I aim to leave UT not just as a graduate, but as a leader who builds systems that ensure no patient is left behind.

**Draft Response**

 
"I did not wait for an opportunity; I built one"

This experience proved that I possess the self-directed learning style required to navigate the iSchool’s flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum. My unique potential lies in combining this "builder" mentality with a clinician’s empathy.

 I aim to elevate this work by joining the **AI Health Lab** under Dr. Ying Ding, specifically contributing to research on interpretable machine learning for precision medicine.

I am also driven to ensure these systems are deployed responsibly. I intend to engage with the **Good Systems** initiative, applying Dr. Ken Fleischmann’s frameworks on AI ethics to healthcare contexts. I will contribute to the university community by bridging the gap between theory and practice; I plan to organize "Technical Resilience" workshops for the student chapter of the **Association for Information Systems (AIS)**, teaching peers how to leverage data engineering skills to navigate volatile job markets. I aim to leave UT Austin not just as a researcher, but as a leader capable of building robust, human-centered health systems.
