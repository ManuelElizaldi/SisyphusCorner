I am applying to the MSIS program in University of Texas at Austin. I am being asked to write an essay (200 - 300 words) asking me this:
Please address any information that you believe your application would be incomplete without and that sheds more light on your unique potential to succeed in the Master of Science Information Studies program and contribute to the university community and the field or profession.

My journey into informatics started with a revelation. After volunteering in the Red Cross In Mexico, I found purpose in helping others. This led me to study Medicine for a semester, but I soon realized this was not my vocation. I then transferred to Economics and discovered that I could impact people's outcomes more effectively through the power of information than clinical practice. 

My application is incomplete without understanding that


my path to Health Informatics was forged through two layoffs. First during Covid, where I took this time as an opportunity to improve my coding skills through University of Austin's Coding BootCamp. Then in 2023 during a period of unemployment where I decided to build my own opportunity selling ethically sourced Mexican coffee, personally architecting the full digital infrastructure. 

I believe these experiences give me the self directed learning style required to *study/take on/* iSchool's flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum. *My career has given me the unique potential in combining technical skills with the clinician's empathy*. Currently, I design data pipelines not just to track metrics, but to ensure patients receive yearly wellness visits. Viewing code as a direct instrument of care.

#### Look into this program - Precision Medicine
I aim to bring this practical, patient-centric engineering experience to **Dr. Ying Ding’s AI Health Lab**. I see a direct application for my skills in her work on **precision medicine**, helping to transform complex medical datasets into actionable insights for the healthcare community.


Furthermore, my diverse work experience has taught me that data is never neutral. 
This motivates my desire to contribute to the **Good Systems** initiative under **Dr. Ken Fleischmann**. I want to use my time at UT Austin to research how we can build AI architectures that are not only efficient but ethically robust. 


I am eager to join the iSchool community, transforming my technical skills into tools that ensure no patient is left behind by the digital revolution. 

I have continued to share knowledge in the Tech community through articles I have written on the advancements of AI and coding.

**Draft Response**

 
"I did not wait for an opportunity; I built one"

This experience proved that I possess the self-directed learning style required to navigate the iSchool’s flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum. My unique potential lies in combining this "builder" mentality with a clinician’s empathy.

 I aim to elevate this work by joining the **AI Health Lab** under Dr. Ying Ding, specifically contributing to research on interpretable machine learning for precision medicine.

I am also driven to ensure these systems are deployed responsibly. I intend to engage with the **Good Systems** initiative, applying Dr. Ken Fleischmann’s frameworks on AI ethics to healthcare contexts. I will contribute to the university community by bridging the gap between theory and practice; I plan to organize "Technical Resilience" workshops for the student chapter of the **Association for Information Systems (AIS)**, teaching peers how to leverage data engineering skills to navigate volatile job markets. I aim to leave UT Austin not just as a researcher, but as a leader capable of building robust, human-centered health systems.
