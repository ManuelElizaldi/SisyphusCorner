I am applying to the MSIS program in University of Texas at Austin. I am being asked to write an essay (200 - 300 words) asking me this:
Please address any information that you believe your application would be incomplete without and that sheds more light on your unique potential to succeed in the Master of Science Information Studies program and contribute to the university community and the field or profession.

---

This application would be incomplete without understanding that my commitment to informatics was formed through my direct experiences with health disparities in underserved regions. I volunteered at the Red Cross in Mexico and decided to study Medicine, but after a semester, I realized this was not my vocation. After transferring to economics, I discovered I could help people more effectively through the power of information than clinical practice. 

  

My unique potential to succeed in the MSIS program is defined by technical resilience and cultural fluency. After facing two layoffs, one during Covid, I took this as an opportunity to join a coding bootcamp at University of Texas. Then during the tech downturn in 2023, I did not wait for a new opportunity. I launched a company that sells ethically sourced coffee, where I architected the digital infrastructure. 

  

My cultural fluency comes from growing up along the Texas-Mexico border, giving me the firsthand knowledge  required to address health disparities in underserved communities. Viewing data not as abstract numbers, but as a key to improving lives, I use code as a direct instrument of care. At my current job, I design data pipelines not just to track metrics, but to ensure patients receive proper care. Continuing my original goal to care for the vulnerable.

  
I believe these experiences give me the self directed learning style necessary to navigate the iSchool’s flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum. I am eager to join the iSchool community, transforming my technical skills into tools that ensure no patient is left behind by the digital revolution.


#### Draft 
My application would be incomplete without understanding that my career has completed a full circle, starting with a basic desire to help people, and returning to healthcare through technical leadership. My initial ambition was solidified by volunteering with the Red Cross in Mexico, though after one semester of Medicine, I realized I could impact patient outcomes more effectively through the power of information than clinical practice.

My unique potential to succeed in the MSIS program is defined by **technical resilience** and **cultural fluency**. After facing two challenging layoffs, I responded by aggressively upskilling in Python/SQL and launching an ethically sourced coffee company, personally architecting its e-commerce and logistics infrastructure. This entrepreneurial experience honed the adaptive, self-directed learning style necessary to thrive in the iSchool’s flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum.1

**Draft Response**

 
"I did not wait for an opportunity; I built one"

This experience proved that I possess the self-directed learning style required to navigate the iSchool’s flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum. My unique potential lies in combining this "builder" mentality with a clinician’s empathy.

 I aim to elevate this work by joining the **AI Health Lab** under Dr. Ying Ding, specifically contributing to research on interpretable machine learning for precision medicine.

I am also driven to ensure these systems are deployed responsibly. I intend to engage with the **Good Systems** initiative, applying Dr. Ken Fleischmann’s frameworks on AI ethics to healthcare contexts. I will contribute to the university community by bridging the gap between theory and practice; I plan to organize "Technical Resilience" workshops for the student chapter of the **Association for Information Systems (AIS)**, teaching peers how to leverage data engineering skills to navigate volatile job markets. I aim to leave UT Austin not just as a researcher, but as a leader capable of building robust, human-centered health systems.
