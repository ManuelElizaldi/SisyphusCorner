## Question 2
The core values of the iSchool are a people-first perspective, information serving humanity, technology for social good, and an interdisciplinary approach. How do your experience and career goals relate to these values?

When I was writing my bachelor's thesis I was feeling overwhelmed by the task, seeking help from my advisor I received an advice that would define my career's trajectory: "Behind every data point and number you work with, there is people". This changed my perspective, giving me a deep sense of purpose where every effort was aimed at maximizing the positive impact. It is this guiding principle that attracts me to the UT iSchool’s MSIS program, from its people first perspective to its mandate for technology to serve humanity.

The commitment to this ideal has also led me toward roles with great human impact. From helping design predictive models that created tangible socio-economic impact in Mexico City, to solving client problems as a data analyst, and most recently where I have felt the most fulfillment, building essential care solutions for patients and optimization processes for providers as a Business Intelligence Developer in healthcare.

In order to continue in this path, I seek the iSchool’s unique interdisciplinary curriculum, focusing particularly on the AI Health Lab to improve my technical skills and the Good Systems initiative to integrate the policy and ethical frameworks necessary to ensure my future work truly embodies technology for social good.



This demand for responsible deployment brings me to the core challenge: my current work on training an LLM for management is continually delayed, not by technical challenges, but by the necessity of finding HIPAA-compliant workarounds to database access. This experience proves that even the most effective solutions fail when divorced from policy and regulatory compliance, reinforcing the need for the **Interdisciplinary Approach**.






My entire career has been a sustained commitment to my advisor's principle: that every number must serve a person.

The iSchool’s curriculum essential framework to advance my work. I am prepared to leverage my technical expertise and passion for human-centered design to ensure that future innovations don't just process data, but truly build systems that work for everyone

Could use for something else:
My current efforts to train an LLM to assist management are continually delayed, not by technical challenges, but by the necessity of finding HIPAA-compliant workarounds to database access. This experience has proven that even the most effective solutions will fail if they neglect regulatory policy, or if the resulting dashboard design fails to meet the end-user's informational needs. The iSchool’s curriculum in information architecture, policy, and ethics—especially **Data Governance and Regulatory Compliance**—is precisely what is needed to bridge this crucial divide between computational power and real-world implementation.

generating immense amounts of data, the critical focus must shift to verifying that the partnership between AI and humans remains beneficial for our well-being.
The iSchool’s AI Health Lab offers the perfect crucible to study and build systems that merge human and algorithmic intelligence, ensuring this collaboration is both effective and ethically sound. I aim to contribute to a field where technology empowers people, rather than creating new vulnerabilities like disinformation.
