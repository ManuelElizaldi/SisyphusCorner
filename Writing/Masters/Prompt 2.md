When I was writing my bachelor's thesis I was feeling overwhelmed by the task, seeking help from my advisor I received guidance that would define my career's trajectory: "The data and numbers you work with are people". This changed my perspective, giving me a deep sense of purpose where all of my efforts are aimed at maximizing the positive impact. It is this guiding principle that attracts me to the UT iSchool’s MSIS program, from its people first perspective to its mandate for technology to serve humanity.

Following this advice has enabled me to explore different industries, shaping an interdisciplinary perspective focused on human impact. From helping design predictive models that created tangible socio-economic impact in Mexico City, to solving client problems as a data analyst, and most recently where I have felt the most fulfillment, building essential care solutions for patients and optimization processes for providers as a Business Intelligence Developer in healthcare.

One of the challenges I am currently working on at my job is building an LLM chatbot to act as an analytics assistant for our leadership team. While the coding is sound, the deployment is delayed as we struggle to adapt these new tools to HIPAA standards. This has taught me that even the best technical solutions are useless if they cannot navigate regulatory landscapes, highlighting the gap in my current training.

In order to continue in this path, I seek the iSchool’s interdisciplinary curriculum, focusing particularly on the AI Health Lab to improve my technical skills and the Good Systems initiative to integrate the policy and ethical frameworks necessary to ensure my future work truly embodies technology for social good.
