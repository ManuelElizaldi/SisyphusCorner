[[Writing]] [[Time Management]]

## Weekly Writing Plan

🔹 **Monday Morning**

- Pick 1 "love letter" or "discussion" idea from your list.
    
- 25-minute writing session (draft it, no editing).
    

🔹 **Wednesday Night**

- Pick 1 technical post idea _or_ sci-fi writing progress update.
    
- 20-minute creative writing session (draft it, let it be raw).
    

🔹 **Friday Morning (optional/light)**

- Quick 15-minute session: Re-read the two drafts lightly.
    
- Only fix clarity or big flow issues — leave grammar polishing for later if needed.
    

🔹 **Publish Day: Saturday or Sunday**

- Choose one or both drafts to finalize and post on Medium or Substack.
    
- (You can polish a little more here if you want, but don't overthink — publishing builds momentum.)

⭐ _Note_:

- Even if a post feels imperfect, publish anyway!
    
- Your voice and skills will sharpen faster _through publishing_, not just drafting.
