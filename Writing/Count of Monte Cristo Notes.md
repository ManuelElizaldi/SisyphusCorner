*Notes on Count of Monte Cristo with some spoilers and ideas*
#### Intro and how this book was first published
The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas, A novel that has a special place in my heart. This was my grandfathers favorite author and although his favorite book by Dumas was the Three Musketeers, this book probably inspired the thousands of trips around the globe that he experienced. 

I also have memories of my cousin, which I see as an older brother, finishing this book during our month long summer vacation back in 2011 (or 2012). I can clearly remember observing him comically holding this massive book in his hands and being fully engaged in the story. Back then I naively thought to myself, "how can people read those long books?" not knowing that years down the road, this would become one of my favorite books. 

My first experience with this novel was during high school, where I had to read it for English class. Of course, as it is natural for any adolescent, the experience of reading was dampen by the obligation of meeting reading deadlines and writing the mandatory essays to get a passing grade. A small note on this, the version I read during this time was an educational copy that was considerably shorter and with less details than a regular translation. 

Anybody that has read a classic book knows that your experience depends heavily on the translation that you choose. Based on my extensive research on this topic - which consisted of asking the Count Of Monte Cristo subreddit which one would be the best choice - I decided on the Penguin Classics translation by Robin Buss. I am grateful that I chose this version because as a a history fan, I appreciate the great introduction to the social and historical context of when and how this book was written. 

For starters, Robin writes that this book was first published as a series in Parisian newspapers similar to what we now have as TV shows. Each day or week provided readers with a new chapter on the life of Edmond Dantes. Back then newspapers were the equivalent to our social media apps, in them you could find the main engine of social discourse, news, events and these serialized stories. It was customary for people  to gather around cafes and bars to discuss new chapters. As a natural born nostalgic for time periods I didn't live in, I would have been ecstatic to be part of those conversations in a Parisian cafes.  

Through this account we get a glimpse at Alexander Dumas' writing process. Publishing a serialized story was highly demanding work, specially for Dumas who lived a eccentric lifestyle similar in nature to the Count of Monte Cristo, but he developed a complex network of collaborators and ghostwriters. They operated more like a production house than a traditional publishing company. This allowed them to master the art of cliffhangers and ensured that readers were engaged so they would buy the next day's newspaper. 

One example of these collaborators was Auguste Maquet, he provided the entire historical research for the Count of Monte Cristo. Because of this some of Dumas' critics nicknamed him a "factory of novels". Comparing his creation process to a soulless mass production of factories. Although this was meant as an insult, when I first learned this I thought that the nickname was formidable. In the distraction ridden world we live in nowadays I strive to become a factory of novels. 

I have to admit that at some point in my life I admired the lone wolf artist that is able to bring his idea to life by pure self-sufficiency, although they do deserve all my respect I have come to realize that the vast majority of great works of art have a common denominator: collaboration was a key ingredient. I first learned about this concept by reading the book [Leonardo Da Vinci by Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci_(Isaacson_book)). I later confirmed this idea by reading Robin Buss' introduction to Count of Monte Cristo. Da Vinci wouldn't have created his art pieces without the teachings and experience gained in Verrocchio's hybrid art school laboratory. And Dumas wouldn't have succeeded as a writer without the help of his company. Although their ends were different - one produced artists and the other created stories, it was the fact that ideas were shared that we remember both of these artists as monumental in their own fields. 

In this regard I also want to mention how important it is for artists to surround themselves with likeminded people. One of Alexander's best friends and creative rivals was Victor Hugo. These two titans of french literature that pioneer the romanticism movement. 

It is also important to note, that one of Alexander's best friends was Victor Hugo, another titan of that era.

#### The plot
Before we talk about the plot, I do have to give a spoiler warning. 

To understand why The Count of Monte Cristo was such a hard hitting novel, you have to picture yourself as an average frenchman during the 1840s. Back then your life consisted of the endless toil of working. Travel was a luxury reserved for the elite, so this left your imagination at the mercy of the rare, second-hand anecdote stories that were often as unreliable as they were rare. Then came Dumas, *nitroglycerin metaphor here*

by creating this world that like nitroglycerin exploded the imagination of a whole nation. 

Within this story you read about pirates, smugglers, the travels of The Count and how he gained the favor of many people with this ability to speak 8 languages. You can even read about a character consuming hashish. This was a 

Robin Buss mentions that one of his friends calls this book a children's novel. First of all it is important to note that his friend is Russian, and we know how insane Russians are with their literature. I would never call a 1200 page book a children's novel, but he does make a good point. The plot of The Count of Monte Cristo is in reality very simple. Our main character gets wrongly imprisoned, escapes from jail, finds a treasure and orchestrates his revenge years later with cold calculated effort. This book even embodies one of the oldest laws of human civilization - The Code of Hammurabi, an eye for an eye. 

Nonetheless within this simplicity you are allowed to delve deeper into the layers of this novel and find great philosophical ideas like the purpose of life. Edmond Dante had everything he could ever ask for after finding his treasure, why set out to exact a revenge? Does struggle bring purpose? 

I also see a deep question about how we behave, having a sort of personal ship of Theseus, after suffering great pain, does Edmond Dante cease to exist to be replaced by the Count of Monte Cristo? There is a stark difference between the character we first meet at the beginning of the story compared to the Count of Monte Cristo. 

But the simplicity of this great work of art also allows us to just sit back and enjoy the story without having to analyze these philosophical themes.
