*Notes on Count of Monte Cristo with some spoilers*
#### Intro and how this book was first published
The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas, A novel that has a special place in my heart. This was my grandfathers favorite author and although his favorite book by Dumas was the Three Musketeers, this book probably inspired the thousands of trips around the globe that he experienced. 

I also have memories of my older cousin, which I see as an older brother, finishing this book during our month long summer vacation. I can clearly remember observing him comically holding this massive book on his hands and being fully engaged in the story. Back then I naively thought to myself, "how can people read those long books?" not knowing that years down the road, this would become one of my favorite books. 

My first experience with this novel was during high school, where I had to read it for English class. Of course, as it is natural for any adolescent, the experience of reading was dampen by the obligation of meeting reading deadlines and writing the mandatory essays to get a passing grade. A small note on this, the version I read during this time was an educational copy that was considerably shorter and with less details than a regular translation. *So reading this now for a second time with a proper translation has been one of the best* <- needs work 

Anybody that has read a classic book knows that your experience depends heavily on the translation that you choose. Based on my extensive research on this topic - which consisted of asking the Count Of Monte Cristo subreddit which one would be the best choice - I decided on the Penguin Classics translation by Robin Buss. I am grateful that I chose this version because as a a history fan, you get a great introduction to the social and historical context of when and how this book was written. 

For starters, Robin writes that this book was first published as a series in Parisian newspapers similar to what we now have as TV shows. Each day or week provided readers with a new chapter on the life of Edmond Dantes. Back then newspapers were the equivalent to our social media apps, in them you could find the main engine of social discourse, having news, social events and these serialized stories published. People would gather around cafes and bars to discuss new chapters. 

Through this account we get a glimpse at Alexander Dumas' writing process. Publishing a serialized story was highly demanding work, specially for Dumas who lived a eccentric lifestyle similar in nature to the Count of Monte Cristo, but he developed a complex system of collaborators and ghostwriters. They operated more like a production house than a traditional publishing company. Thanks to this, they mastered the art of cliffhangers and ensured that readers were engaged so they would buy the next day's newspaper. 

One example of these collaborators was Auguste Maquet, he provided the entire historical research for the Count of Monte Cristo. Because of this some of Dumas' critics nicknamed him a "factory of novels". Comparing his writing process to a soulless mass production of factories. Although this was meant as an insult, when I first learned this I thought that the nickname was formidable. In the distraction ridden world we live in nowadays I strive to become a factory of novels at some point. 

I have to admit that at some point in my life I admired the lone wolf artist that is able to bring his idea to life by pure self-sufficiency, and although they do deserve all my respect I have come to realize that the vast majority of great works of art have a common denominator: collaboration was a key ingredient. I first learned about this by reading the book [Leonardo Da Vinci by Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci_(Isaacson_book)). Then I confirmed this idea by reading Robin Buss' introduction to Count of Monte Cristo. Da Vinci wouldn't have created his works without the teachings and experiences that he gained in Verrocchio's hybrid art school laboratory. Same goes for Dumas and his company of writers. Although their ends were different - one produced artists and the other created stories, it was the fact that ideas were shared

#### The plot
Robin Buss mentions that one of his friends calls this book a children's novel. First of all it is important to note that his friend is Russian, and we know how insane Russians are with their literature. I would never call a 1200 page book a children's novel, but he does make a good point. The plot of The Count of Monte Cristo is in reality very simple. Our main character gets wrongly imprisoned, escapes from jail, finds a treasure and orchestrates his revenge years later with cold calculated effort. This book even embodies of the oldest laws of human civilization - The Code of Hammurabi, an eye for an eye. 

You have subplots of smugglers, priates, exotic lands and historical details that keep you entertained. 


Nonetheless within this simplicity you can find 


this simplicity you have pirates, smugglers, travel to exotic lands and even philosophical discussions, the meaning of life and death 


Nonetheless within this simplicity you can find


Star wars
