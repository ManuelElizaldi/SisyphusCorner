*Notes on Count of Monte Cristo with some spoilers and ideas*
#### Intro and how this book was first published
The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas, A novel that has a special place in my heart. This was my grandfathers favorite author and although his favorite book by Dumas was the Three Musketeers, this book probably inspired the thousands of trips around the globe that he experienced. 

I also have memories of my cousin, which I see as an older brother, finishing this book during our month long summer vacation back in 2011 (or 2012). I can clearly remember observing him comically holding this massive book in his hands and being fully engaged in the story. Back then I naively thought to myself, "how can people read those long books?" not knowing that years down the road, this would become one of my favorite books. 

My first experience with this novel was during high school, where I had to read it for English class. Of course, as it is natural for any adolescent, the experience of reading was dampen by the obligation of meeting reading deadlines and writing the mandatory essays to get a passing grade. A small note on this, the version I read during this time was an educational copy that was considerably shorter and with less details than a regular translation. 

Anybody that has read a classic book knows that your experience depends heavily on the translation that you choose. Based on my extensive research on this topic - which consisted of asking the Count Of Monte Cristo subreddit which one would be the best choice - I decided on the Penguin Classics translation by Robin Buss. I am grateful that I chose this version because as a a history fan, I appreciate the great introduction to the social and historical context of when and how this book was written. 

For starters, Robin writes that this book was first published as a series in Parisian newspapers similar to what we now have as TV shows. Each day or week provided readers with a new chapter on the life of Edmond Dantes. Back then newspapers were the equivalent to our social media apps, in them you could find the main engine of social discourse, news, events and these serialized stories. It was customary for people  to gather around cafes and bars to discuss new chapters. As a natural born nostalgic for time periods I didn't live in, I would have been ecstatic to be part of those conversations in a Parisian cafes.  

Through this account we get a glimpse at Alexander Dumas' writing process. Publishing a serialized story was highly demanding work, specially for Dumas who lived a eccentric lifestyle similar in nature to the Count of Monte Cristo, but he developed a complex network of collaborators and ghostwriters. They operated more like a production house than a traditional publishing company. This allowed them to master the art of cliffhangers and ensured that readers were engaged so they would buy the next day's newspaper. 

One example of these collaborators was Auguste Maquet, he provided the entire historical research for the Count of Monte Cristo. Because of this some of Dumas' critics nicknamed him a "factory of novels". Comparing his creation process to a soulless mass production of factories. Although this was meant as an insult, when I first learned this I thought that the nickname was formidable. In the distraction ridden world we live in nowadays I strive to become a factory of novels. 

I have to admit that at some point in my life I admired the lone wolf artist that is able to bring his idea to life by pure self-sufficiency, although they do deserve all my respect I have come to realize that the vast majority of great works of art have a common denominator: collaboration was a key ingredient. I first learned about this concept by reading the book [Leonardo Da Vinci by Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci_(Isaacson_book)). I later confirmed this idea by reading Robin Buss' introduction to Count of Monte Cristo. Da Vinci wouldn't have created his art pieces without the teachings and experience gained in Verrocchio's hybrid art school laboratory. And Dumas wouldn't have succeeded as a writer without the help of his company. Although their ends were different - one produced artists and the other created stories, it was the fact that ideas were shared that we remember both of these artists as monumental in their own fields. 

In regards to collaboration, I also want to mention how important it is for artists to surround themselves with people that have the same creative energy. One of Alexander's best friends and creative rival was Victor Hugo, author of Les Misérables. These two titans of french literature spent many hours exchanging ideas. They navigates several periods of uncertainty with the rise and fall of Napoleon, and the subsequent reinstatement of the Monarchy. 

**This still needs work**

They had to perfect their craft because artists were no longer performing for a patron, but rather, they had to satisfy the artistic demands of the people. 


It is known that both attended each others theatre plays and then gave feedback. Each represented a benchmark of success where a healthy creative competition was ever present within these two titans. 

#### The plot
Before we talk about the plot, I do have to give a spoiler warning. 

To understand why The Count of Monte Cristo was such a hard hitting novel, you have to picture yourself as an average frenchman during the 1840s. Back then your life consisted of the endless toil of working. Travel was a luxury reserved for the elite, so this left your imagination at the mercy of the rare, second-hand anecdote stories that were often as unreliable as they were rare. Then came Dumas, like nitroglycerin dropped into the collective imagination lit up a whole nation with his story.

Within this novel you read about pirates, bandits, the travels of The Count to exotic lands and carnivals in Rome. We are entertained by the Counts charisma and his vast knowledge of 8 different languages. His skillfulness with science and the always present tangible thrill of not knowing how he will have his pay back. 

Robin Buss mentions that one of his friends calls this book a children's novel. First of all it is important to note that his colleague is Russian, and we know how insane Russians are with their literature. I would never call a 1,200 page book a children's novel, but he does make a good point. The plot of The Count of Monte Cristo is in reality very simple. Our main character gets wrongly imprisoned, escapes from jail, finds a treasure and orchestrates his revenge years later with cold calculated effort. This book even embodies one of the oldest laws of human civilization - The Code of Hammurabi, an eye for an eye. 

Nonetheless within this simplicity you are allowed to delve deep into themes of sublime complexity. One of this ideas is related to the [Ship of Theseus Paradox](https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/enquiries/view/the-ship-of-theseus). When we first meet our main character, he is in the cusp of great happiness. He is about to be promoted to captain, he is able to help his father economically and will soon marry the love of his life. Tragically, right when he is about to have all that he wished for, he is arrested and taken to the Château d’If. There he spends 14 years without any connection to the outer world. Through hopeless pain he endured the isolation of this fortress of (in)justice. It was so much pain that we could argue that the meekness nature of Dante was transformed into a ruthless intelligence that allowed him to plot the revenge against his trespassers. 

"One always hurries towards happiness, Monsieur Danglars, because when one has suffered much, one is at pains to believe in it. But I am not impelled by mere Selfishness. I have to go to Paris. "

Like the Ship of Theseus, we must wonder: does the essence of a person survive the total replacement of their character after great agony? Or, like the Count, are we destined to become strangers to the people we used to be?

Another idea I pondered when reading this novel was 

Jean-Jacques Rousseau
Another idea I pondered about while reading about Villefort's two sons is 

Are we naturally born good or are we born evil. During this story you learn about The Count's enemy Villefort's sons. Bennedetto and Edouard. Both of them seem to have an evil nature, despite only being children.
