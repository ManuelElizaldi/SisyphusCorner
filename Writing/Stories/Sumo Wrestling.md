Yokozuna -> Top Rank 

Start as a farmer? maybe? they wrestle for fun, they wrestle the goats 

when our character reaches the 'stable' - where sumos live and train together - he is tasked with chores, sometimes his fellow sumo partners abuse of him, similar to Thrall with the Frostwolf clan. They are testing his character. Character is built through hardship, the constant hammering and rebinding of someone's spirit.  Through the repetition of the tasks he found discipline and attention to detail. 

Japan's national religion - Shinto 

"when I go to Dohyo ring, I always believe I am the stronger. Even if they are bigger. I raise my fighting spirit so that I believe that I can beat anybody " - from doc min 6:20 | Asashoryu
