[[AI]] [[Game Development]] [[Experiment]]
### Reason for Graveyard
I am not that interested now in writing something about how I reshaped my relationship with AI, instead maybe I want to reframe this article on how I am learning game development a long wanted dream of mine that connects me to my childhood dream or something like that. 

Watering this article was a good exercise, but I don't think it will see the light of day. Although, there are some great ideas in here that I could recycle.

## Introduction

If you are anything like me, you believe that that AI can't create art. Art, in my opinion is only born from the soul, it blooms from the human experience. For this reason, when I saw this video -  ["How Stanford Teaches AI-Powered Creativity in Just 13 Minutes | Jeremy Utley"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv779vmyPVY),recommended on my YouTube home page, I couldn't avoid smirking. How is AI going to fuel my creativity? If anything, AI is a great troubleshooting tool, but not a source of creative energy. 

Although I was doubtful, I decided to watch the video in spirit of learning something new or perhaps reaffirming my existing beliefs on AI. 

I recommend you watch the video, but let me give you the main idea:"*Treat AI as a teammate, not a tool*. Don't use AI, work with AI. Artificial Intelligence can teach you how to use itself contrary to any other technology."

This idea excited me because I spent most of my childhood watching Anakin Skywalker depend on R2D2 or Master Chief on Cortana, the idea of treating AI as a teammate intrigued me.

Inspired by this video and my recent read of the book [Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow_(novel)) - the story of 3 game developer friends, I decided to put Jeremy Utley's idea to the test. I wanted to work with AI to learn Game Development, a task that combines creativity and technical skills. 

But before I dive into the details of the experiment, I want to give you a little context about me. 

Gaming has always been an important part of my life, it offered comfort during moments of distress, it allowed me to stay connected to my friends when I was studying college in a different city and believe it or not, it was thanks World of Warcraft that I can speak English confidently.

#### The above paragraph feel a little bit rushed? rough?
#### Why is gaming art? work on this paragraph

That's why gaming is important on a personal level, but let's face the fact, gaming is another expression of art. The different graphical styles and the depth of stories give us the undeniable fact that gaming is art. 

My intention for learning Game Development is to deepen my appreciation for this art form. As Leonardo Da Vinci once wrote: "The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding."

Now in regards to my technical skills, I have been programming for about 4-5 years. Although most of my expertise comes from a data analysis and data management environment, I am confident enough on my technical skills to embark on this journey. 

#### should I mention something about me always wanting to learn game dev?

## Body
*could insert a small sentence to start this section*

The video by Jeremy Utley suggested an approach where you ask for a consultation from you favorite flavor of AI, the prompt can look something like this:

```
you are a AI expert. Your help will be greatly appreciated and your consultation as well. Ask me questions, one by one to decide on the best strategy for me to learn game development.
```

Why are we talking so nicely to the AI? I do not know. But I much rather do this than to risk a 'Terminator' scenario. 

*I love this idea, it needs some polishing, but overall I like where its going:*
I went ahead and added extra details to fine tune the strategy for me. I have tackled monumental tasks before and I am aware that the task its self is not the whole challenge. 

The mental part of a challenge is equally if not harder than the skill you are trying to learn. 

 I am not new to my mind creating doubts and believing false ideas of myself. I am well aware that a new frame of mind is needed. So I decided to add extra details to this prompt, with hopes of reducing the obstacles in this journey.

Here is my revised prompt:

```
```

I previously read both [Learning How to Learn by Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/learning-how-to-learn/) and [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322) and these books are filled with knowledge treasures that can help you navigate the challenges of learning. 


after that, you tell it to ask questions, one by one - this is important to best define your strategy.

This created certain pressures


I don't want AI to generate code, or provide any creative input. I want it to handle the parts of the process of learning Game Development that would - not let me focus on the process of learning - <- modify this idea


Gaming has been an important part of my life, I have learned the value of progress, teamwork and it even helped me practice my English.

I have always appreciated the art of video games but once I started coding, there was always an itch for Game Development. It was not until I read the book referenced and I watched this video that I thought about embarking on an experiment. People are always talking about the potential risks for AI or the paradise of benefits it will bring, but this is all noise to me. I wanted dig deep and seek the truth. 

I believe that through this experiment I will find an even deeper appreciation for this hobby that has accompanied me for so many years and also help me further my learning both of myself and programming.
