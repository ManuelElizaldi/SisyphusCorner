AI + Cloud + IOT devices in hospitals 

Patients in hospitals are surrounded by devices gathering information. This can be stored in a cloud storage where we can then deploy an AI model to analyse and help health providers nurture patients to health. 
With the power of IoT and Cloud backed with AI, healthcare can improve. 
Likewise, we can track if the care that is given provided is actually helping. 

We are surrounded by devices, each gathering information about how we live.
