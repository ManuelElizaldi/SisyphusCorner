Remember to use voice memos

Set a time for review idea list - once a week. Its okay to cross out ideas that you are no longer excited about. 

Use pomodoro method to write -> 20 - 25 min sessions

Writing during the morning:
1. Make coffee
2. Open the idea list and choose something, don't over think it
3. Set the timer
4. Write freely - editing comes later, get the thoughts in the page
5. After the timer stops, you can keep going or stop there.

Writing at night -> here, ideas are more weird/wild. This is a creative window. Exploit it
1. Dim the lights slightly
2. Play music or write in silence - whatever feels best at the moment
3. Since its night time, pick a more "imaginative" idea
4. Place timer - 20 minutes is recommended
5. Write with "no rules" mindset - weird is good at night
### Idea template
**Title or Hook** (one sentence or phrase)  
	→ What would grab attention? (example: "Espresso Bars: The Last Romantic Places")

**Key Feeling or Theme** (one word or phrase)  
	→ What emotion or idea do you want to convey? (example: "nostalgia", "grit", "playfulness")

**One Line of Expansion** (optional)  
	→ What’s one thought you might explore? (example: "The scent of fresh coffee feels like a daily ritual of hope.")


### Writing Sketch - Frame to get started
### ✏️ **Article 1 (Love Letter): "Espresso Bars: The Last Romantic Places"**

**Type:** Love letter (short, 2–3 paragraphs)

**Structure idea:**

- **Opening (1-2 sentences)**:  
    Capture a feeling — why are espresso bars special to you? (e.g., "In a world spinning faster every day, espresso bars feel like the last places where time slows down.")
    
- **Middle (1 paragraph)**:  
    Describe the experience — sights, smells, sounds. Maybe mention how strangers share space quietly, a small ritual that connects people.
    
- **Closing (1-2 sentences)**:  
    End with a personal touch — why you keep coming back. (e.g., "Maybe it's not about the coffee at all. Maybe it's about remembering we're still human.")
    

### ✏️ **Article 2 (Discussion): "Rugby vs Football: Grit vs Art"**

**Type:** Discussion post (longer, 3–5 paragraphs)

**Structure idea:**

- **Opening (2-3 sentences)**:  
    Introduce the idea — you love both sports, but they feel very different in spirit.
    
- **Section 1 (1 paragraph)**:  
    Describe Rugby — emphasize physical grit, teamwork, rough beauty.
    
- **Section 2 (1 paragraph)**:  
    Describe Football (Soccer) — emphasize elegance, creativity, flow.
    
- **Comparison (1 paragraph)**:  
    Where they overlap, and where they are completely different. Maybe even mention how _watching or playing_ feels different.
    
- **Closing (1 paragraph)**:  
    Share your personal favorite moment in each sport — and invite readers to think about how different kinds of "strength" exist.
