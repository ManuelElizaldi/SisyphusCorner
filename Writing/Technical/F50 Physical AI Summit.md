[[AI]] [[Manufacturing]] [[Finance]]
David Cao -> Founder of F50 

As someone with a background in economics and a deep passion for history, I have always been interested in the subject of the industrial revolution. You could argue that this historical event still has an impact on the lives of many workers today. But we are in the beginning of a new industrial revolution fueled by microchips, robots and data centers. 

As it's common with any new technology, high expectations and doubts linger in the thoughts of people following its progress. So to have the chance to attend [F50 Physical AI Summit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/f50/) and hear the thoughts and opinions of top talent was a great opportunity to learn about the current state of AI and what the future could look like.

Here are my top takeaways from these conversations and some challenges that were discussed.

## Key Take Aways

### AI Agents - Your little robot helper
Most of the focus nowadays is given to LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc.) and although they have revolutionized the way many people work, there are other branches in AI that are underutilized.

One of this is AI Agents, If you are not familiar with this tool, you can think of them as little helper robots that specialize in specific tasks, usually manual, mundane and repetitive. 

Aashish Naik from the cybersecurity company Netspoke talked about his experience using AI agents to automate repetitive tasks. Each day, cybersecurity companies get slammed with thousands of alerts. Most of them are false triggers, but employees still have to parse these and determine if they require attention. According to Aashish, this is a mundane and tedious task, so they started deploying AI agents trained on identifying which alerts are serious and what can be discarded. 

This is very exciting, because now cybersecurity engineers can start investing their time and knowledge on more purposeful tasks. 

I haven't explored this aspect of AI yet, but I am already brain storming about how to deploy AI Agents, one example I thought about was to use an agent to parse all of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes and act as a study partner. 

### Farmers 
When people discuss the impact AI has on the economy, an industry that often gets overlooked, although it has huge importance for humanity is farming. High cost of labor and inputs plus unpredictable variables causes profit margins to be slim. In recent years [42% of farmers in the US where profitable](https://usafacts.org/articles/farmer-demographics/). That is why there is huge untapped potential for AI to bring benefit to agriculture. 

According to Jaleh Daie from Aurora Equity, AI can bring 40 - 85% savings, and one way this new technology is already helping farmers is by deploying AI models to aid in [phenotype analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311923003611). This type of study helps farmers reduce disease and boost reproductive cycles in crops. Deploying farmer robots could also address the ever [growing lack of people willing to work on this field](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor).
### Big Impact - Ideas Bridge Industries
From robots that help with drug disposal developed by K3 Integrated, to AI that helps engineers provide infrastructure maintenance deployed by PWC, AI is here to help us. 

A pattern I noticed in all of these speakers was that they had a true sense of purpose and they all want to bring good to humanity through AI. 

AI is an innovation that will bridge industries, one project that provides safety in construction can then be applied to the healthcare sector. We are still in the beginning and it is truly an amazing time to see this technology develop. 

## Challenges
### Infrastructure - Power Hungry
A couple of years back around 2021, GPUs were a scarce resource, if you had one you struck gold. Now that roadblock has been solved and naturally a new challenge is upon us, the challenge of building and powering the infrastructure necessary for AI. Texas by itself has 397 data centers according to the [Data Center Map](https://www.datacentermap.com/usa/), with plenty more on the way, based on the talk by Glenn Hamer from [Texas Association of Business](https://www.txbiz.org/. All of these buildings require power, massive amounts of power, so the quest to harness more energy is of great importance. 

Oil, Wind and solar already supply a good amount of energy, but our energy needs will just keep growing. So the questions remains how are we going to power all of this infrastructure? 

Despite public skepticism and some anxiety, something that was discussed during the summit was the possible comeback of nuclear energy. By building smaller and more manageable nuclear plants, we could solve this challenge in the coming years. Everything tends to solve itself and I am truly curious to see how this will develop. 

### The Bubble
Reminiscent of the .com bubble in the 2000s, there's still a prevalent fear of being in a AI bubble. You don't need to be a Wall Street Quant to see that people are exploiting this technology just for the sake of 'hype'.

It seems that by saying that your company has AI capabilities, you'll have customers begging to consume your product and investors wanting to be part of it. For example, this [company that makes saladas](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/just-salad-turns-artificial-intelligence-help-guests-build-their-lunch) uses AI to design your perfect meal. This is a classic case of over engineering, they are using a super computer to solve a simple 2+2 operation. Come on, just give me my cesar salad! 

Bubble or not, I believe we are still in the beginning stages of this new AI revolution and we are trying to figure out where does this tool best fit. 

### Adoption - Luddites
Roughly around 1810, during the beginning of the industrial revolution, there was a group of people who were strongly opposed to the new textile machines. They were nicknamed luddites and they raided factories and caused a whole lot of trouble. 

In current times, similar to the Luddites, there are people who are against the inexorable progress of AI. For example, in dystopian fashion, there's an AI project aimed to be a [Friend](https://friend.com/). They had a marketing campaign in the NYC metro which was ruined, and by looking at the [pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1nw2100/an_ai_company_just_spent_1_million_on_print/), you can tell that there's reluctance to AI. Of course this project is a particular example and I doubt there's going to be resistance to other applications of AI in the future, causing adoption to grow overtime.

### Ethical concerns and regulation
Although I am excited for the progress of AI and the economical benefits it can bring, the experts from the summit are not blind to the fact that implementing AI can displace many workers. How we address this as a society and what legal systems we build will be of great importance.
