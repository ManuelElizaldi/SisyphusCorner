[[AI]] [[Manufacturing]] [[Finance]]
David Cao -> Founder of F50 

As someone with a background in economics and a deep passion for history, I have always been interested in the subject of the industrial revolution. You could argue that this historical event still has an impact on the lives of many workers today. But we are in the beginning of a new industrial revolution fueled by microchips, robots and data centers. 

As it's common with any new technology, high expectations and doubts linger in the thoughts of people following its progress. So to have the chance to attend [F50 Physical AI Summit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/f50/) and hear the thoughts and opinions of top talent was a great opportunity to learn about the current state of AI and what the future could look like.

Here are the top takeaways from these conversations and some challenges that were discussed.

## Key Take Aways

### Agents
Most of the focus of AI nowadays is given to LLMs, although they are powerful tools that have helped me boost my productivity, there are other areas that most people, including myself are under utilizing.

One of these branches of AI is Agents. Aashish Naik from the cypersecurity company Netspoke talked about his experience using AI agents to automate repetitive tasks. 

Each day, cybersecurity companies get slamed with thousands of false alerts. Although most of them are not serious threads, people still have to parse these and determine if they requiere attention. According to Aashish, this is very mundane and repetitive, so they deployed an AI agent that helps employees from Netspoke parse through this alarms coming to central base. 

This is very exciting, because now cybersecurity engineers can start investing their time on more impactful/purposeful tasks. 

I haven't explored this aspect of AI but I am already thinking about deploying an AI agent that can help me parse through all of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)notes.

### Farmers 
When people discuss the impact AI has on the economy, an industry that often gets overlooked, although it has huge importance for humanity is farming. High cost of labor and inputs plus unpredictable variables causes profit margins to be slim. In recent years [42% of farmers in the US where profitable](https://usafacts.org/articles/farmer-demographics/). That is why there is huge untapped potential for AI to bring benefits to farmers. 

According to Jaleh Daie from Aurora Equity, AI can bring 40 - 85% savings, and one way this new technology is already helping farmers is by deploying AI models to aid in [phenotype analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311923003611). This type of study helps farmers reduce disease and boost reproductive cycles in crops. The help of automated robots can also address the ever [growing lack of people willing to work on this field](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240325-artificial-intelligence-ai-us-agriculture-farming).


## Job Opportunities 
The fear of AI taking your job, I don't think it will happen.

## Challenges
### Infrastructure - We Need The Whole Stack
A couple of years back around 2021, GPUs were a scarce resource, if you had one you struck gold. Now that roadblock has been solved and naturally a new challenge is upon us, the challenge of building and powering the infrastructure necessary for AI. Texas by itself has 397 data centers according to the [Data Center Map](https://www.datacentermap.com/usa/), with plenty more on the way, according to Glen Hamer. 

All of these buildings require power, lots and lots of power, so the quest to harness more energy is of great importance. Wind and solar already represent some of the energy we use but we will still need more. Despite public skepticism and some anxiety, nuclear energy could make a come back. 

In addition to this, AI is global industry that requires talent and resources from around the world. 

### The Bubble
Reminiscent of the .com bubble in the 2000s, there's still a prevelant fear of being in a AI bubble. You don't need to be a Wall Street Quant to see that people are exploiting this technology just for the sake of 'hype'. 


It seems that you can have a [company that makes Saladas](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/just-salad-turns-artificial-intelligence-help-guests-build-their-lunch) and say you are using a top of the line LLM AI model to attract investors and potential customers. They are using a super computer to solve a simple 2+2 operation. Come on, just give me my cesar salad! 

### Adoption - Luddites

Roughly around 1810, during the beginning of the industrial revolution, there was a group of people who were strongly opposed to the new textile machines. They were nicknamed luddites and they raided factories and caused
