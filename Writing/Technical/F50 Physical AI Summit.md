David Cao -> Founder of F50 

As someone with a background in economics and a deep passion for history, I have always been interested in the subject of the industrial revolution. You could argue that this historical event still has an impact on the lives of many workers today. But we are in the beginning of a new industrial revolution fueled by microchips, robots and data centers. 

As it is common with any new technology, high expectations and doubts linger in the thoughts of people following the progress of this industry. So to have the chance to attend [F50 Physical AI Summit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/f50/) and hear the thoughts and opinions of top talent was a great opportunity to learn about the current state of AI and what the future could look like.  <- *Might need some improvement in the last sentence*

I also had the opportunity to learn how my home state, Texas, is setting its self up for success by prioritizing infrastructure to supply new Data Centers and micro chip factories with enough energy to fit their needs combined with the right legal and physical infrastructure 

So I wanted to share my top key takeaways and talk a little bit about the challenges facing this new industry.

## Challenges
### Infrastructure - We Need The Whole Stack
A couple of years back around 2021, GPUs were a scarce resource, if you had one you struck gold. Now that roadblock has been solved and naturally a new challenge is upon us, the challenge of building and powering the infrastructure necessary for AI. Texas by itself has 397 data centers according to the [Data Center Map](https://www.datacentermap.com/usa/), with plenty more on the way, according to Glen Hamer. 

All of these buildings require power, lots and lots of power, so the quest to harness more energy is of great importance. Wind and solar already represent some of the energy we use but we will still need more. Despite public skepticism and some anxiety, nuclear energy could make a come back. 

In addition to this, AI is global industry that requires talent and resources from around the world. 

### The Bubble
Reminiscent of the .com bubble in the 2000s, there are still thoughts about how we are on a AI bubble. You don't need to be a Wall Street Quant to see that people are exploting this technology just for the sake of 'hype'. It seems that you can have a [company that makes Saladas](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/just-salad-turns-artificial-intelligence-help-guests-build-their-lunch) and say you are using a top of the line LLM AI model to attract investors and potential customers. They are using a super computer to solve a simple 2+2 operation. Come on, just give me my cesar salad!
