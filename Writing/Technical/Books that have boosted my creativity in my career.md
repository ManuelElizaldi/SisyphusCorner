Most people when they hear programming, the last thing they would associate this job with is: creativity. But, I will be the first person to stand my ground and state other wise. Maybe programming is not your typical art discipline where you write, compose nor paint, but in this field you have to be able to *describe what the creative programming process looks like here* (connect to this idea) ->just as a painter finds art within the space that surrounds him. 

For this reason, I find that engaging with media about the creative process something stimulating that inspires my work. 

1) The Artist's Way - Julia Cameron: 
	- This book shows you how to trust your gut.

This books is structured through weekly chapters that contain lessons and practices that help you connect with your inner creative energy source. It might sounds _a bit out there_ (could use another phrase) but learning how to listen to your instincts is key in the creative process. 

Let me give you an example, have you ever had an idea struck you like lightning? Out of no where you have an idea for a business, or about how to overcome that hurdle at work. Well, if you have, you know what I am talking about and Julia is a master at teaching you how harness this instinct to have a thunderstorm of ideas. 

On top of all this, this book was gifted to me by my mom, so thanks mom!

2) The Creative Act - Rick Rubin: This book is my North Star

As a wanna be anarchist angsty teenager 

3) Growth Mindset - Carol S. Dweck Ph.D.
	- This book showed me: Nothing is fixed, everything can be improved. Anything is possible
