Some people when they hear programming, the last thing they would associate this job with is: creativity. But, I will be the first person to stand my ground and state other wise. Maybe programming is not your typical arts discipline where you write, compose nor paint, but in this field you have to be able to solve problems finding solutions in *describe what the creative programming process looks like here* (connect to this idea) ->just as a painter finds art within the space that surrounds him. 

For this reason, stimulating my inspiration through creative media (books, movies, YouTube videos, documentaries, etc.) is key for success. 

1) _Growth Mindset - Carol S. Dweck Ph.D._: This book showed me that nothing is fixed, everything can be improved. Anything is possible.

I grew up playing video games, especially RPGs, so the idea of leveling up is natural to me. That said, I thought this was something that could only be applicable within the realm of virtual worlds. It did not seem something that was innate to school, relationships, hobbies or work.

If you decide to read this book, you will shift your mindset from an outcome focus to an effort focus. This means that you wont set so much value on the result of a task, but rather, you will "fall in love with the process", through this a whole lot more of benefits will cascade, which I will let you discover for yourself, however let me tell you about a personal anecdote. 

I used to determine my self worth by how much I achieved,

Failed relationship -> something was wrong with me
Struggled with a subject at college? I had no future 
Compared myself to others, without paying attention at how much hours they were spending learning and practicing compared to me.

2) _The Artist's Way - Julia Cameron_
	- This book shows you how to trust your gut.

This books is structured through weekly chapters that contain lessons and practices that help you connect with your inner creative energy source. It might sounds odd but learning how to listen to your instincts is key in the creative process. 

Julia Shows you how to channel this creative force through the use of several exercises, but I find that the key practice is Morning Pages or better known as stream of consciousness writing. 

Let me give you an example, have you ever had an idea struck you like lightning? Out of no where you have an idea for a business, or about how to overcome that challenge at work? Well, if you have, you know what I am talking about and Julia is a master at teaching you how harness this instinct to have a thunderstorm of ideas. In this book she shows you how to be open to receiving and acting upon those strokes of insight. 

On top of all this, this book was gifted to me by my mom, so thanks mom!

3) _The Creative Act - Rick Rubin_: This book is my North Star

Music is a greatly important to me, it allows me to decorate space and find inspiration. So, when I saw that the monk music producer that created one of my favorite albums of all time: [South of Heaven by Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_Heaven)wrote a book on creativity, my inner metalhead was curiously excited to read all his teachings. 

This book is structured in a way that you can read one lesson a day and feel in tune with your inner creative source. It is jam packed with hard hitting quotes like:
