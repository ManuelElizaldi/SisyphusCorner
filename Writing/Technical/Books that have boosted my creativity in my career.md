Some people when they hear programming, the last thing they would associate this job with is: creativity. But, I will be the first person to stand my ground and state other wise. Maybe programming is not your typical arts discipline where you write, compose nor paint, but in this field you have to be able to solve problems finding solutions in *describe what the creative programming process looks like here* (connect to this idea) ->just as a painter finds art within the space that surrounds him. 

For this reason, I believe that through stimulating my inspiration with the right creative media (books, movies, YouTube videos, documentaries, etc.) is key -> key for what??? why do I want to be creative in my career? 
	- fun? 
	- enjoy the process

1) _Growth Mindset - Carol S. Dweck Ph.D._: This book showed me that nothing is fixed, everything can be improved. Anything is possible.

I grew up playing video games, especially RPGs, so the idea of leveling up is natural to me. That said, I thought this was something that could only be applicable within the realm of virtual worlds. It did not seem something that was innate to school, hobbies, work or relationships.

If you decide to read this book, you will shift your mindset from an outcome focus to an effort focus. This means that you wont set so much value on the result of a task, but rather, you will "fall in love with the process", once you learn this, a whole lot more of benefits will cascade, which I will let you discover for yourself, however let me tell you about a personal anecdote:

I used to determine my self worth by how much I achieved. If my relationship was healthy, subconsciously I associated this with me being worthy of love. Solving the dynamic system's equations from my college course filled me with exultation, whereas failing the subject meant that a prosperous future was out of my realm of possibilities.

I would compare my failed outcomes to my peer's without acknowledging that they probably invested more effort studying and practicing. 

This was an emotional seesaw that tired me. 

Carol S. Dweck came in and cleansed this false beliefs from my system.
Wanting to achieve your goals is not inherently bad. Having objectives can enrich your life. The issue arises when you believe that your achievements increase your worthiness as a person.  


Of course, sometimes I slip back into those negative thoughts, but at least I am aware that they are irrational.  

2) _The Artist's Way - Julia Cameron_
	- This book shows you how to trust your gut.

This books is structured through weekly chapters that contain lessons and practices that help you connect with your inner creative energy source. It might sounds odd but learning how to listen to your instincts is key in the creative process. 

Julia Shows you how to channel this creative force through the use of several exercises, but I find that the key practice is Morning Pages or better known as stream of consciousness writing. 

Let me give you an example, have you ever had an idea struck you like lightning? Out of no where you have an idea for a business, or about how to overcome that challenge at work? Well, if you have, you know what I am talking about and Julia is a master at teaching you how harness this instinct to have a thunderstorm of ideas. In this book she shows you how to be open to receiving and acting upon those strokes of insight. 

On top of all this, this book was gifted to me by my mom, so thanks mom!

3) _The Creative Act - Rick Rubin_: This book is my North Star

Music has been greatly important to me throughout my life, it allows me to decorate space and find inspiration. So, when I saw that the monk music producer that created one of my favorite albums of all time: [South of Heaven by Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_Heaven)wrote a book on creativity, my inner metalhead was curiously excited to read all his teachings. 

This book is structured in a way that you can read one lesson a day and feel in tune with your inner creative source. It is jam packed with hard hitting quotes like: 

"Good habits create good art. The way we do anything is the way we do everything. Treat each decision you make, each action you take, each word you speak with skillful care. The goal is to live life in the service of art. "

If I ever feel like I am slipping into bad habits, I pop open this bad boy and read some of Rick's wisdom. This is the right course correction any creative needs.
