Most people when they hear programming, the last thing they would associate this job with is: creativity. But, I will be the first person to stand my ground and state other wise. Maybe programming is not your typical arts discipline where you write, compose nor paint, but in this field you have to be able to *describe what the creative programming process looks like here* (connect to this idea) ->just as a painter finds art within the space that surrounds him. 

For this reason, stimulating my inspiration through creative media (books, movies, YouTube videos, documentaries, etc.) is key for success. 

1) _The Artist's Way - Julia Cameron_: 
	- This book shows you how to trust your gut.

This books is structured through weekly chapters that contain lessons and practices that help you connect with your inner creative energy source. It might sounds _a bit out there_ (could use another phrase) but learning how to listen to your instincts is key in the creative process. 

Julia Shows you how to channel this creative force through the use of several exercises, but I find that the key practice is Morning Pages or better known as stream of consciousness writing. 

Let me give you an example, have you ever had an idea struck you like lightning? Out of no where you have an idea for a business, or about how to overcome that hurdle at work. Well, if you have, you know what I am talking about and Julia is a master at teaching you how harness this instinct to have a thunderstorm of ideas. Through this book she shows you how to be open to receiving and acting upon those strokes of insight. 

On top of all this, this book was gifted to me by my mom, so thanks mom!
