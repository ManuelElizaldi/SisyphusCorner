I’m excited to share that I have successfully completed the **Post Graduate Program in Cloud Computing** from **The University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business**.

This program has been an incredible journey into understanding how cloud infrastructure is fundamental to modern enterprise. I am genuinely excited about how cloud computing is revolutionizing the way businesses scale and operate at a global level—moving from rigid on-premise systems to flexible, borderless solutions.

One of the most impactful parts of the curriculum was studying how to leverage the cloud to deploy AI tools. Seeing the synergy between scalable cloud architecture and artificial intelligence has given me a new perspective on how we can build smarter, more resilient systems.

During the program, I covered a comprehensive range of topics, including:

- **Cloud Foundations & Architecture**
    
- **AWS:** Cloud Computing, Managed Services, & DevOps
    
- **Microsoft Azure:** Essentials & Managed Services
    
- **AI on the Cloud:** Masterclass on deploying AI services
    
- **Capstone Project**
    

I look forward to applying these skills to solve complex infrastructure challenges.
