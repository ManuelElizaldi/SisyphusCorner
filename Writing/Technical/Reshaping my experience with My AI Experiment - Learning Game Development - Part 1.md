I recently stumbled upon this video: ["How Stanford Teaches AI-Powered Creativity in Just 13 Minutes | Jeremy Utley"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv779vmyPVY), which made me rethink my relationship to AI. If you are anything like me you would smirk at a title like that. I don't believe that AI can create art - although there are some interesting works out there - art, in my opinion is only born from the soul, the human experience. - maybe something is missing here.

There's no possible way AI can boost creativity, or so I thought. <- this introduction feels better, it might steel need some work. 

Alas, in the spirits of satisfying my own curiosity I watched the video with the hope of perhaps learn something new or reaffirm my existing belief.

Could continue this idea:
I used to be against using AI for my creative projects, but after watching this video, I realized that my stance was not against AI itself but AI created content.

Assuming many people in this platform have the same stance as I do regarding AI, I truly recommend you watch it, you might learn something new.  <- need a connecting idea to the following paragraph:

To give you a run down of the main idea: Don't use AI, work with AI. AI can teach you how to use itself contrary to any other technologies. *Treat it as a teammate, not a tool*.

That last part was really intregin to me since I am a sci-fi fan and grew up watching Anakin rely on R2D2 through out all his adventures, so I thought this could be a new interesting way of interacting with AI. 

Inspired by this event and my recent read of the book [Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow_(novel)) - the story of 3 friends and game developers - I designed an experiment to prove the usefulness of AI. ??? <- not sure if this what I am trying to answer with this experiment. 

To give a little context about me, I have been programming for the last 4-5 years in a data analysis and data management context. When I first learned programming I did it because I had some courses in college where I had my first exposure to using computers to solve complex problems and I also wanted a job in tech. All that learning was stimulating


** maybe talk here about how I did it with the goal in mind of landing a job, but I also had fun doing it because its something that truly excites me, but not in a soul flirting kind of way

Gaming has been an important part of my life, I have learned the value of progress, teammwork and it even helped me practice my English.

I have always appreciated the art of video games but once I started coding, there was always an itch for Game Development. It was not until I read the book referenced and I watched this video that I thought about embarking on an experiment. People are always talking about the potential risks for AI or the promise land of benefits it will bring, but this is all noise. I wanted to see for myself how far can this technology take me. 

Based on the notes I took about the video I designed a prompt to ask chatgpt for guidance on my goal: Being able to design a Gaming Engine. 

I believe that through this experiment I will find an even deeper appreciation for this hobby that has accompanied me for so many years and also help me further my learning both of myself and programming.
