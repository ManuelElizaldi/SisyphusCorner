> In my career and personal life


When I first read these books, my objective was to become a better programmer. Some people when they hear coding/programming, the last thing they would associate this job with is: creativity. But, I will be the first person to stand my ground and state otherwise. In this discipline you need to be able to design the right solutions for a problem using your imagination.

I wanted to share my experiences in how I use the knowledge gained from these authors in the programming world. However as I was writing these words I soon noticed these books have helped not just in my career, but in the whole complicated spectrum of life.


1. _Growth Mindset - Carol S. Dweck Ph.D._: This book showed me that nothing is fixed, everything can be improved. Anything is possible.

I grew up playing video games, especially RPGs, so the idea of leveling up is natural to me. That said, I thought this was something that could only be applicable within the realm of virtual worlds. It did not seem something that was innate to school, hobbies, work or relationships.

If you decide to read this book, you will shift your mindset from an outcome focus to an effort focus. This means that you wont set so much value on the result of a task, but rather, you will "fall in love with the process". Once you learn this, a whole lot more of benefits will cascade, which I will let you discover for yourself, however let me tell you about a personal anecdote:

As a side effect of being a highly achieving person, I sometimes tend to determine my self worth by how much I accomplish. If my relationship was healthy, subconsciously I associated this with me being worthy of love, so when I went through a bad breakup a couple of years ago, my reality frame was fractured, leaving me trying to understand if I was fit for a relationship.

Solving the dynamic system's equations from my college course filled me with exultation, whereas failing the subject meant that a prosperous future was out of my realm of possibilities. I would compare my failed outcomes to my peer's without acknowledging that they probably invested more effort studying and practicing.

This was an emotional seesaw that served me no good.

Carol S. Dweck came in and cleansed this false beliefs from my system. Wanting to achieve your goals is not inherently bad. Having objectives can enrich your life. The issue arises when you believe that your achievements increase your worthiness as a person.

Of course, sometimes I slip back into those negative thoughts, but at least I am aware that they are irrational. 

2. _The Artist's Way - Julia Cameron_
    - This book shows you how to trust your gut.

This books is structured through weekly chapters that contain lessons and practices that help you connect with your inner creative energy source. It might sounds odd but learning how to listen to your instincts is key in the creative process.

Julia Shows you how to channel this creative force through the use of several exercises, but I find that the key practice is 'Morning Pages' or better known as stream of consciousness writing.

Let me give you an example, have you ever had an idea struck you like lightning? Out of no where you have an idea for a business, or about how to overcome that challenge at work? Well, if you have, you know what I am talking about and Julia is a master at teaching you how harness this instinct to have a thunderstorm of ideas. In this book she shows you how to be open to receiving and acting upon those strokes of insight.

On top of all this, this book was gifted to me by my mom, so it has immense emotional value for me, so thanks mom!

3. _The Creative Act - Rick Rubin_: This book is my North Star

Music has been greatly important for me throughout my life, it allows me to decorate space and find inspiration. So, when I saw that the monk music producer that created one of my favorite albums of all time:Â [South of Heaven by Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_Heaven), wrote a book on creativity, my inner metalhead was curiously excited to read all his teachings.

This book is structured in a way that you can read one lesson a day and feel in tune with your inner creative source. It is jam packed with hard hitting quotes like:

"Faith allows you to trust the direction without needing to understand it."

"Your desire to create must be greater than your fear of it."

"If you're making something for God, there's no higher form, and you're putting your purest intentions into it"

If I ever feel like I am slipping into bad habits, I pop open this bad boy and read some of Rick's wisdom. This is the right course correction any creative needs.
