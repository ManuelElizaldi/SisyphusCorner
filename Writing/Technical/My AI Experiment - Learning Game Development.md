I recently stumbled upon this video: ["How Stanford Teaches AI-Powered Creativity in Just 13 Minutes | Jeremy Utley"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv779vmyPVY), if you believe that AI and creativity are opposites, reading this title makes you *something*

I used to be against using AI for my creative projects, but I realized that my stance was against AI creating. I believe that art can only be created from the soul, but maybe that's a conversation for another article. 

So in spirit of satisfying my curiosity I watched the video with the hope of perhaps learn something new or reaffirm my existing belief.

To give you a run down of the main idea: Don't use AI, work with AI. AI can teach you how to use itself contrary to any other technology. Treat it as a teammate, not a tool.

But, I do recommend you watch the video for yourself, perhaps you'll learn something new as I did.

Before watching this video, I only used AI to troubleshoot my code or as a question and answer chat. But since I am a huge sci-fi fan and grew up watching Anakin rely on R2D2, I thought this could be a new interesting way of interacting with AI. 

Inspired by this event and my recent read of the book [Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow_(novel)) I designed an experiment to prove the usefulness of AI. ??? <- not sure if this what I am trying to answer with this experiment.
