I am trying to learn video game development. I want to possibly build an engine, but I have cero knowledge on this topic. I do know how to program in python, I know my programming logic like (if, but, ors, <,>, etc.) I would rate my level on this logic a 7 out of 10 but I have never programmed something like that.

I am also aware of some phycological barriers like insecurities I would need to over come, insecurities on the topic, like feeling afraid or incapable of doing it (learning game development) 


So If I wanted to use this project as a learning process. Both in programming skill and mental health, what should my strategy be? Help me decide goals on the short, mid and long term. Take into account my schedule. 

Ask me one questions one at a time to decide on the strategy
