I am going to make changes to the introduction:

If you are anything like me, you believe that that AI can't create art. Art, in my opinion is only born from the soul, in blooms from the human experience. I could explore this idea in a future article, but today I want to talk about an experiment I am going to run on myself to prove if any of the paradise of benefits supposedly offered by AI are true.

I recently stumbled upon this video: ["How Stanford Teaches AI-Powered Creativity in Just 13 Minutes | Jeremy Utley"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv779vmyPVY), after reading a title like that I couldn't avoid smirking. How is AI going to fuel my creativity? If anything, AI is a great troubleshooting tool, but not a source of creative energy. 

Although I was doubtful, I decided to watch the video in spirit of learning something new or perhaps reaffirming my existing beliefs on AI.

The main idea of the video is: *Treat it as a teammate, not a tool*. Don't use AI, work with AI. Artificial Intelligence can teach you how to use itself contrary to any other technology.

After spending most of my childhood watching Anakin Skywalker depend on R2D2 or Master Chief on Cortana, the idea of treating AI as a teammate intrigued me.

Inspired by this video and my recent read of the book [Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow,_and_Tomorrow_(novel)) - the story of 3 friends, their relationship and their journey as game developers, I decided that I wanted to purse a long wanted dream of mine: *Learning Game Development*

Can AI be a teammate in the process of learning game development? 

The video by Jeremy Utley suggested an approach where you ask for a consultation from you favorite flavor of AI, after that, you tell it to ask questions, one by one - this is important to best define your strategy. I made sure to add extra details like using research done by 2 experts in learning, [Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/) and [Carol Dweck](https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck). I decided to add these references because I know emotional/physcological barriers are inevitable when tackling a big task, especially if its something I have wanted to do for a long time. So I wanted the AI to offer some inputs on how to best tackle this. 





To give a little context about me and why I want to embark on this experiment: I have been programming for the last 4-5 years in a data analysis and data management context. When I first learned programming I did it because I had some courses in college where I had my first exposure to using computers to solve complex problems and I also wanted to land a job in tech. Although all this learning was truly exciting, the end goal was always to land a job. 

This created certain pressures


I don't want AI to generate code, or provide any creative input. I want it to handle the parts of the process of learning Game Development that would - not let me focus on the process of learning - <- modify this idea


Gaming has been an important part of my life, I have learned the value of progress, teamwork and it even helped me practice my English.

I have always appreciated the art of video games but once I started coding, there was always an itch for Game Development. It was not until I read the book referenced and I watched this video that I thought about embarking on an experiment. People are always talking about the potential risks for AI or the paradise of benefits it will bring, but this is all noise to me. I wanted dig deep and seek the truth. 

I believe that through this experiment I will find an even deeper appreciation for this hobby that has accompanied me for so many years and also help me further my learning both of myself and programming.
