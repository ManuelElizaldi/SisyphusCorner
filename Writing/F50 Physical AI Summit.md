As someone with a background in economics and a deep passion for history, I have always been interested in the subject of the industrial revolution. You could argue that this historical event still has an impact on the lives of many workers today. But we are in the beginning of a new industrial revolution fueled by microchips, robots and data centers. 

High expectations and questions linger in the thoughts of people following the advances of this industry, so to have the chance to attend a summit with the top people on this field was a great opportunity to learn *something*

I listen to the ideas and discussions from tops of the field like Jaleh Daie who works with robots for agriculture and food systems and Ari Gorman who uses robots in the healthcare industry to make processes more efficient (mention drug disposal) 

I also had the opportunity to learn how my home state, Texas, is setting its self up for success by prioritizing infrastructure to supply new Data Centers and micro chip factories with enough energy to fit their needs combined with the right legal and physical infrastructure 


So I wanted to share the top 3 opportunities and 2 challenges that I got from this summit 


challenges
- 



## Glen Hamer - Texas Association of Business
Texas GPD is almost 7th in the world. It's like a country. 
*I have to read the economic plan by the federal government*: https://www.ai.gov/

Priority in infrastructure
importing micro chips but also want to build our own

SP29 -> Law of texas -> business judge board decisions 

Nuclear, solar and wind 

Defense is important since it has become a very important state 

https://www.txbiz.org/txbiz-pac/ <- there is some important information about the voting ballot 
- **I need to text this dude and ask him about the ballot (maybe) 737 336 6590**

#### Not for article, but still fun facts
Tan parker AI policy 
Ted cruz and the internet regulation in the 90s 


## Jim Penniman - Cedar Park Mayor 
veteran and reelected, history buff 

Quality of life is a priority to keep attracting talent

## Srini Bala - Atlas Cloud
AI 


Physical AI - it touches the real world 

IQ Land Phillip Boykin -> real estate AI 
### Panel
Austin Next Jason Scharf - Investor

Physical AI is present in many industries 

Supply chain is the key -> having resources 
- we need the whole stack 
- we needed chips, then we needed data centers, then we needed energy. Everything fixes itself overtime 

build small and more manageable nuclear plants 

Manufacturing 

New investing model Jaleh Daie - Venture Capital needs to reinvent the investing model 

money is going to made in companies that are full stack -> chips, pigs and shovel companies  Jaleh 

PROSEC production security a part from national security 


Human autonomy in AI? Capital of autonomy 
Austin is a leader for sure | use case heaven, like a big laboratory 
Regulation 

Miami cargo shipping AI 

## Reimagine investment in the physical world
Anita Biddappa BVA Operating Partner 
Lyzz Torres Astronomic Head of Investor Relations 

Cognitive and semi conductor 

Ideas that bridge multiple ideas -> something that can work in manufacturing safety + hospital security -> same concept applied to many industries 

early signs for an idea to grow? industry experience helps to identify. 

dont think about "will it bring me returns" think about the wave it can cause 

Traditional investment rule -> adapt, adapt, adapt 

## Physical AI from imagination to adoption

Twirlista -> robot that makes latte art - Jessie Wang CEO 

Ari Gorman K3 Integrated 
dispose of drogs in hospitals - chain of custody - determine where the drug is and if it should be 
early failures -> throwing money at the problem doesn't work. Simulations help.
Making people adopt technology | people meeting the robot -> robot beer dispensing displaced jobs, so there's ethical considerations
you have to work with AI experts and industry experts 

Kunal Saxena PWC Advisory 
thunderstorms all across the state or fires - utility malfunction. 
Physical AI can help to be prepared for disaster or to prevent disaster 
early failures -> monitoring, field technicians learning the technology. Revisit and build foundation. Pre and post solution 
Making people adopt technology | people meeting the robot -> CICD tool that went into an error loop that caused the model to be unplugged. You need to be prepared 


Colleen Reidelbach Qubika SVP of client strategy 
XOI field technicians -> AI eyewear to get support from HQ 
Qubika has a client/company that works with imbedded software 
Early failure -> risk factors is not understanding the end user well enough, can't picture their life, incentives, and safety. You need buy in from the people close to the technology 

## Yijin Liu - future of battery manufacturing 
Walker department of mechanical engineering 


## The Super AI expert panel 
Aashish Naik - Netspoke cybersecurity 
AI helps attending thousands of alerts in the cyber security central base


Mukul Bafana - Omunin CEO

Collin Sellers - provlabs - blockchain infrastructure 

Lior Kolnik Eve security - head of product
