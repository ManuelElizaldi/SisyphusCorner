I hear people want freedom, but as I wake up this Saturday morning, not having to work and with the whole day ahead of me, I feel somewhat anxious not knowing what to do with all this free time. Filled with spontaneity any impulse can decide my next step, so needing my daily dose of caffeine, I make myself my morning coffee on my espresso machine. 

I am using a roast from the land of the Kilimanjaro - Tanzania. I bought this bag of beans in the capital of Barbecue, Lockhart, Texas at Chaparral coffee shop. The bag features a road runner and the phrase "Be Good to Your Neighbors". Drinking the coffee I taste some smokey caramel that soothes my urge to be caffeinated. 

After the morning ritual of energizing myself is dealt with, I then take a cold shower, a juxtaposition from the warmth of my americano. I decide to wear my faded black wranglers, my "Yo si subi al Teposteco" UFO t-shirt and put on my sandals to venture off to satisfy my next impulse, the most human sensation: hunger

My craving for the pastrami sandwich with perfectly smoked fatty meat, hugged by a buttery toasted bread and paired with lettuce and tomatoes that pierce through the fat like a honed katana, propels me to the deli shop behind my apartment. I was driven by purse impulse, so I forgot to check the opening hours. To my dismay, the restaurant was closed. 

An important rule to which everyone should live by is to know that there is always another option, or at least, that's what my mother tells me. So looking around my neighborhood, a couple of blocks away I spotted the familiar neon lights that spell "OPEN", a lighthouse that guides the hungry castaways to safety. 

When I got to the food truck I was greeted by a lovely couple of Jarochos offering traditional Veracruz food. Torn between Zacahuil and Huachinango I found myself charging like a mad bull at the Red chilaquiles. I ordered mine with beef and an extra fried egg. 

A moment of silence ensued while I waited for my food, so I flipped open the entrance stone to the world of Kafka by the Shore. Within this realm there's an absence of time which casts an uncanny grip on me, reminiscent of Juan Rulfo's Pedro Paramo. Dead people appear to be alive, alter egos manifest as crows and cats provide helpful tips, if you know how to talk to them. 

While reading I admire the way Murakami writes. It's as if I am following Kafka Tamura through the forest, driven by his impulse and guided by two dead World War II soldiers. After a rigorous trek they reach another dimension and the soldiers warn Kafka by letting him known that if he's not careful, he could remain there forever. 

Through Kafka Tamaura's description of this place I get the impression that this alternate reality is built on nostalgia. There's a forest cabin that resembles the one Oshima lend Kafka in the real world. But strangely, this version doesn't feel right, somehow it evokes a wistful, eerie  atmosphere.

Somewhere along the road I learned that nostalgia means the pain from an old wound. It can act as a delicate, but potent emotional anchor that keeps us living in the past continually stuck repeating our ways. It renders useless any power we can exercise on our life. 

Just as the soldiers warned Kafka, it can become easy to live in the past. Kafka kept believing in the curse set by his father and kept perpetuating the anger he felt by the abandonment of his mother. Instead of welcoming the unknown, we subconsciously or consciously, prefer to continue suffering, holding on to the hollow mirage of a dead ideal that can't withstand the pressures to build a life.

After a couple of minutes of reading, my trance is broken by the welcoming sight of my red chilaquiles, a beautiful manifestation of Mexican cuisine. The fried tortillas smothered in red salsa had the perfect consistency, some parts crunchy, others soft which carried the the bomb of spicy flavor to my mouth. And to top it all of, the crowning jewel of a fried egg.

There's a part in the the book where Kafka lets go of what is known before heading into the forest. He decided to leave the sense of safety that his tools provided and stepped into the dark parts of his mind performing a self inflicted mental catharsis. By giving in to the unknown we obtain the power to forgive ourselves and our transgressors. We rid ourselves of the curse set by life's circumstances. 

Between the struggles of a run away teenager, the friendship of a truck driver and an old quirky guy that talks to cats, I find myself with more questions than answers while reading Kafka by the Shore, but maybe that was Murakami's intention when he told this story. An invitation to venture forth to the unknown.
