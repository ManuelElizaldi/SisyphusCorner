I hear people want freedom, but as I wake up this Saturday morning, not having to work today and with the whole day ahead of me I find myself not knowing what to do with all this time. Any impulse can decide my next step, so needing my daily dose of caffeine,  I make myself my morning coffee in my espresso machine. I then take a cold shower, wear my black faded wranglers, my "Yo si subi el Teposteco" tshirt and put on my sandals to venture off to satisfy the most human sensation: hunger 

Right now I am craving the perfectly smoked pastrami sandwich in the perfect homemade butter toasted bread skillfully toasted with the right amount of butter that is sold behind my apartment in a deli shop.As I walk there I imagine the scene, my right hand holding this beautiful expression of food and my fingers lathered in the fat of the sandwich. Bitting into the meat and feeling how the lettuce and tomatoe slice right through the fat like a hoaned katana.

Being driven by my impulses, I forgot to check the opening times and when I got there to my dismay, it was closed. My mother used to say that an important skill to have in life is knowing that the world doesn't end when you don't get your way. There's always plenty of options. So as I searched around for another spot to eat, I saw neon lights that spelled "OPEN" in the horizon. They pulled me to safety like a lighthouse guiding a hungry castaway. 

When I got to the food truck I was greeted by a lovely Mexican couple that offered traditional Veracruz food. Between Zacahuil and Huachinango I found myself charging like a mad bull at the Red Chilaquiles with beef and a fired egg on top. 

A moment of silence ensued while I waited for my food so I flipped open the entrance stone to the world of Kafka by the Shore. Within this realm there's an absence of time which casts an uncanny grip on me, reminiscent of Juan Rulfo's Pedro Paramo. Dead people appear alive and well, alter egos manifest as crows, Johnny Walker crafts a flute made of cats and cats provide helpful tips - if you know how to talk to them. 

Leaving me with more questions than answers.

While I read, I felt like I was in the company of Kafka Tamura while he is walking in the deep forest. Giving in to the unknown. Guided by lost world war 2 soldiers he reaches a place built on nostalgia where the it felt like sand was swallowing him. The mirage of dead ideal, a long lost place. You can find comfort here, but if you stay too long you'll make the old pain real. 

After a couple of minutes of reading, my transce is broken by the welcoming sight of my red chilaquiles, with the extra egg I asked as the crowning jewel to this beautiful manifestation of Mexican cuisine. The fried tortillas smothered in red salsa had the perfect consistency, some parts crunchy, others soft, carrying the the vessel of flavor to my mouth.
