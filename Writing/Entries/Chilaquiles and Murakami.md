I hear people want freedom, but as I wake up this Saturday morning, not having to work today and with the whole day ahead of me I find myself not knowing what to do with all this time. Any impulse can decide my next step, so needing my daily dose of caffeine,  I make myself my morning coffee in my espresso machine. I then take a cold shower, wear my black faded wranglers, my "Yo si subi el Teposteco" tshirt and put on my sandals to venture off to satisfy the most human sansation: hunger 

Right now I am craving the perfectly smoked pastrami sandwich with homeade bread perfectly toasted that probably received the perfect amount of butter before throwing it on a hot pan. As I walk to the deli I imagine the scene, my right hand holding this beautiful expression of food and my fingers lattered in the fat of the sandwich. Being driven by my impulses, I forgot to check the openin times for the deli and when I got there, to my dismay, I was surprised by a closed deli. 

My mother used to say that an important skill to have in life is knowing that the world doesn't end when you don't get your way. There's always plenty of options. So as I searched the neon lights that spelled "OPEN" in the horizon pulled me to safety like a lighthouse guiding a hungry castaway. 

When I got to the food truck I was greeted by a lovely Mexican couple that offered traditional Veracruz food. Between Zacahuil and Huachinango I found myself charging like a bull at the Red Chilaquiles with beef and a fired egg on top. 

A moment of silence ensued while I waited for my food so I flipped open the entrance stone to the world of Kafka by the Shore. In this realm, time doesn't matter, it casts an uncanny grip on me, similar to Juan Rulfo's Pedro Paramo leaving me with more questions than answers. Alter egos manifest as crows, cats give advice and Johnny Walker is crafting a flute made of cats.
