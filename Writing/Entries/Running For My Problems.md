"Physical source for emotional detachment"

Yesterday while I was running my 5 kilometers in extreme Texas heat (93Â°) at 12:00 pm, fueled by absolutely nothing but black coffee, I though about how I run from my problems.

Like some runners today, I started running in 2020, needing a reason to get out of the house, running was the perfect excuse. Going for a run during quarantine felt like an Edward Hopperian dream, no cars, no people. Only a deep sense of calming solitude. Having graduated that year from college uncertainty was forever looming, I had no idea what I was going to do with my life but I had the reassuring certainty that I could go for a run.

When I first started running I used music as a booster, I would crank it up, listening to metal, hip hop punk or anything that had a good beat with a high BPM that I could match with my stride. High BPM, high running octane. Funny enough, now I don't listen to any music. There was an inevitable internal adjustment that made me prefer the sounds of my surroundings, having no music blasting inside my head allows my thoughts to be loud and clear. All of my insecurities, worries, and longings are on display. This allows me to dance (run) with my demons.

Sometimes setting a purpose before the run helps me think deeply about what can I do about it. Looking back to 2023, the year I was laid off from my job and spend a year hunting for a new gig. During my search I. My day consisted of opening rejection letter after rejection letter, filling me with frustration, it felt like all these hours I was putting into applying to jobs were for nothing. I would log in early to LinkedIn, apply to as many openings as I could, then I would go for a run. It almost seemed like running kept me sane. Logging in miles, logging in the applications. That kept me going. Just like running, time moves forward and so should I. Again I was faced with the inevitable uncertainty of life  

Stay positive when being negative and cursing at the world seems like the easier thing to do. Running came to the rescue. I had a friend that didn't understand why I was running so much, incessant interrogations of how I feeling, of course I felt like crap but what else is there to do, sit and cry? Nope, I had to log in those miles. Races that I needed to prepare for. 

Running has taught me that the only way life can take is forward. *<- something like that*, you can't be like John Mayer and ask life to stop this train. 

You learn to find happiness even if you are surrounded by suffering. Feet might be hurting, cramping, you might be frustrated looking for a sjob but running shows you that you can find comfort in pain. Knowing that you are still fighting. Running teaches you to know that you will be at the finish line. 

You against you, you can be your worst enemy. It's so easy to be negative, to give in to the negative emotions within you. But running teaches you not to hear those voices. Those voices only slow you down.

Running provides a soothing detachment from my problems. During the time I spend hitting the pavement with my pace I can observe my thoughts, and find solutions to my problems.
