Yesterday while I was running my 5 kilometers in extreme Texas heat (93Â°) at 12:00 pm, fueled by absolutely nothing but black coffee, I though about how I run for my problems.

This habit of mine started back in 2020. Needing a reason to get out of the house, running was presented as the perfect excuse. Going for a run during quarantine felt like an Edward Hopperian dream, no cars, no people. Only a deep sense of calming solitude. Having graduated that year from college, uncertainty was forever looming. I had no idea what I was going to do with my life but I had one reassuring certainty: I could go for a run. 

Since life is a repetition of itself I try to remember the important lesson running offers to those brave enough to endure the pains of logging in the miles. The soothing detachment offered by running allows you to accept that life only moves forward. Passionate loves fade, friendships drift apart, houses get torn down but you shall only hold on to what you think will last and keep running. 

Another year, another challenge. 2023 comes by and I get laid off. This leads to a year long hunt for a new gig. Thankfully the practice of running for my problems was there to offer respite for the spirit tainting frustration of opening rejection letter after rejection letter.

That year my days consisted of logging in to LinkedIn, racking up the applications and then racking out the miles. My ability to focus on what I can control was tested. All the hours I spent applying to jobs and not getting what I was looking for made it hard to remains optimistic amidst all the rejection.   

When you run something magical happens. Your body is going to complain, naturally, it does not want to do hard things. 

It is easy to give in to the negative voices in your head screaming you to stop and go back to your house. You can become your worst enemy. 

You learn to find happiness even if you are surrounded by suffering. Feet might be hurting, cramping, you might be frustrated looking for a job but running shows you that you can find comfort in pain. Knowing that you are still fighting. Running teaches you to know that you will be at the finish line. 

I had a friend that didn't understand why I was running so much, incessant interrogations of how I feeling, of course I felt like crap but what else is there to do, sit and cry? Nope, I had to log in those miles. Races that I needed to prepare for.
