Yesterday while I was running my 5 kilometers in extreme Texas heat (93Â°) at 12:00 pm, fueled by absolutely nothing but black coffee, I though about how I run for my problems.

This habit of mine started back in 2020. Needing a reason to get out of the house, running was presented as the perfect excuse. Going for a run during quarantine felt like an Edward Hopperian dream, no cars, no people. Only a deep sense of calming solitude. Having graduated that year from college, uncertainty was forever looming. I had no idea what I was going to do with my life, but I had a reassuring certainty: I could go for a run. 

Since life is a repetition of itself I try to remember the important lesson running offers to those brave enough to endure the pain of logging in the miles. The soothing detachment offered by running allows you to accept that life only moves forward. Passionate loves fade, friendships drift apart, houses get torn down but you shall hold on to what you think will last and keep running. 

Another year, another challenge. 2023 comes by and I got laid off. This lead me to a year long hunt for a new gig. Thankfully the practice of running for my problems was there to offer respite from the spirit tainting frustrations of opening rejection letter after rejection letter.

That year my days consisted of logging in to LinkedIn, racking up the applications and then racking out the miles. Everything I have learned about stoicism (focusing on what I can control and let everything else be) was tested. All the hours I spent applying to jobs and not getting what I was looking for made it hard to remains optimistic amidst all the rejection.   

When you run, your mind and body complain. Cramps, body pain and negative thoughts corner you and scream at you to stop. Naturally, it is easy to give in to these complains, you need to enforce an active effort to ignore the negative signals and continue your run. I once heard that you can become your worse enemy, I believe this to be true and there is no other place where this is more palpable than when you go for a run.

After every run, your spiritual muscle to remain optimistic is trained. Rep after rep you learn to find comfort even if you are surrounded by pain or/and frustration. Feet might be hurting, muscles might be cramping, you might be 500 application in to a job hunt, but the run continues.

I am not sure if running is an act of escapism, but I am certain that going out for a run does helps me look at my problems from a different angle. Somehow the struggle of running makes whatever I am facing less heavy on the spirit. There's no stoping this train, life will continue. There is a finish line where we are able to find what we ask for. Keep your nose on the grind stone and go for a run.
