"The faintest ink is better than the best memory"
Title pending

Man Men, season 3, episode 10. Paul Kinsey copy writer for an advertisement company is struck with an idea for his project. Too excited for his own good, after his bourbon fueled work session he forgets to write down his idea and dozes off into slumber. Next day he is faced with the consequences of his (in)action. Through pain and regret he exclaims "The faintest ink is better than the best memory".

As fleeting as they are, I try my best at capturing ideas. Pen and paper preferably. Some ideas are useful, some are just curiosities. Others are just ideas. I act upon some, others I don't. Some lead me to writing love letters and others simply remind me to buy milk at the grocery store. 

I find writing down ideas down works best for me. I always keep a pen and somewhere to write near me. You never know when you are going to be stricken by an idea. These days I even keep a small notebook on my bedside table. The stillness before falling asleep presents itself as a fertile ground for ideas to blossom. Typing them on my phone isn't for me, although I know some people that do. If I do that, I tend to abandon them. 

Some days, ideas refuse to come, I try to fill my pages with ink but they stay blank. The garden of ideas refuses to give any fruit. In these moments I struggle, one of the worst feelings is having the intention to write, but finding nothing worth writing about. But I keep at it with faith, knowing there will be rewards. Just as anything worth doing. Relationships have their fare share of disagreements. There are days where I feel sluggish during my workouts. 

^ the above paragraph needs a conclusion. 

Ideas come and go, but the ones that stay and are cultivated can manifest into beautiful works of art. The way artists are able to transform a simple idea into works of art inspires me. Songs, movies, video games, social movements, everything is born from ideas and they are able to ----  

Don't let ideas fly away, once gone they will have no place to grow. 


, it was poetic how he refered to the idea flying away. Who hasn't been through that? I want to write something about this feeling. The struggle of having something precious in your hands and then it just goes away. 
- This might be related in some way but I think the song "waiting on a song is related to this feeling"
- capture God's whispers <- this could be the title
