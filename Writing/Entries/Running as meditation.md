## Running as meditation - maybe these thoughts could be used for another piece

"Running, because there's more ways of meditating than sitting"

Running has become a weird masochistic form of meditation that I have come to hold dear in my heart. 

Running has helped me to stay on the path of working out. Lifting weights sometimes feel like to much work, but I know that I need to move. Movement is medicine, my easy way out is hitting the road and run at least 3 km, that is the bear minimum. 

I am no stranger to high millage, half, full and ultra marathons, but 3 miles is enough to get a good workout in. Plus the mental clarity obtained after a good workout is --- a word for something that feels really good. I have yet to found/encounter a moment after a run where I regret doing it. Every time after a run I feel grateful that I am able to move like I do. Taking care of your body is a blessing

I enjoy running more during the winter compared to the summer, but that doesn't stop me. I have been putting myself on uncomfortable positions - running in prime time heat. Sometimes it feels unbearable, but I push through, I cheer myself to keep going. (I actually say this to myself). To be honest, I don't know why I expose myself to this level of suck. There is no profound reason to do this, maybe there should be a reason. There's no commandment that tells me I need to suffer the way I do during those fasted runs in the heat, but I do it because I can and because I feel amazing afterwards. masochistic meditation

usually after a run, I have a lot to write about, ideas fly around in my mind. I wish I could write with a notebook. 

I remember my dad talking about how he ran 10 km everyday during college. I think that's where I first thought about adopting this practice. I even remember he ran a half marathon once, my mom, my brother and I went to cheer him on. I remember he was cramping real bad, he even screamed, I wonder why he stopped running

When I first started running I used music as a booster. I would crank it up, listening to metal, hip hop punk or anything that had a good beat with a high BPM that I could match with my stride, high BPM, high running octane. Funny enough, now I don't listen to any music. There was an inevitable internal adjustment that made me prefer the sounds of my surroundings, having no music blasting inside my head allows my thoughts to be loud and clear. All of my insecurities, worries, and longings are on display. This allows me to dance (run) with my demons.
