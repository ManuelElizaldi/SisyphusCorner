Thought reflection on ideas

Mad Men, season 3, episode 10 - The Color Blue. Paul Kinsey copy writer for an advertisement company, is struck with an idea for his project after a bourbon fueled work session. Too excited for his own good and perhaps a bit too drunk, he forgets to write down his idea and dozes off into slumber. Next day he is faced with the consequences of his (in)action. Through pain and regret he exclaims "The faintest ink is better than the best memory".

As fleeting as they are, I try my best at capturing ideas. Pen and paper preferably. Some ideas are useful, they give me an answer to problems I need to solve. Other ideas are just curiosities. I act upon some, others I don't. Some lead me to writing love letters and others simply remind me to buy milk at the grocery store. 

I find writing down ideas down works best for me. I always keep a pen and somewhere to write handy. You never know when you are going to be  illuminated by an idea. These days I even keep a small notebook on my bedside table. The calm stillness before falling asleep presents itself as a fertile ground for ideas to blossom. Typing them on my phone isn't for me, writing them down on my notes app is just like throwing them into the graveyard of ideas. 

Some days, ideas refuse to come, I attempt to fill my pages with ink but they remain unchanged: blank. The garden of ideas refuses to give any fruit. In these moments of blockage I struggle because one of the worst feelings is having the intention to write, but finding nothing worth writing about. But I keep at it with faith, knowing there will be rewards. What else is there to do? To Give up? Just as anything worth doing, you have to commit. Relationships have their fare share of disagreements and there are days where I feel sluggish during my workouts. 

The funny thing is, the more I commit to writing everyday, the easier ideas come to me. Everyone has a different reason to continue on their path, yet we cannot deny that by overcoming the periods of resistance, we are able to find ourselves.
 
Ideas come and go, but the ones that stay and are cultivated can manifest into beautiful works of art. Don't let ideas fly away. Once gone they will have no place to grow. Everything around us, anything that you find dear and close to your heart was born from an idea. Books, movies, social movements, everything starts from a simple idea. A moment of inspiration places something precious in your hands.
