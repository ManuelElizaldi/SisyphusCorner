I hear people want freedom, but as I wake up this Saturday morning, not having to work today and with the whole day ahead of me I feel somewhat anxious not knowing what to do with all this free time. Filled with spontaneity, any impulse can decide my next step, so needing my daily dose of caffeine, I make myself my morning coffee on my espresso machine. 

I am using a roast from the land of the Kilimanjaro - Tanzania. I bought this bag of beans in the capital of Barbecue, Lockhart, Texas at Chaparral coffee shop. The bag features a road runner and the phrase "Be Good to Your Neighbors". Drinking my americano I taste some smokey caramel that soothes my urge to be caffeinated. 

After the morning ritual of energizing myself is dealt with, I then take a cold shower, a juxtaposition from the warmth of my americano. I decide to wear my faded black wranglers, my "Yo si subi el Teposteco" t-shirt and put on my sandals to venture off to satisfy my next impulse, the most human sensation: hunger

My craving for the perfectly smoked pastrami sandwich in the homemade butter toasted bread with lettuce and tomatoes that pierce through the fatty meat like a honed katana propels me to the deli shop behind my apartment. As I was driven by purse impulse, I forgot to check the opening hours and to my dismay, the restaurant was closed. 

An important rule to which everyone should live by is to know that there is always another option, or at least that's what my mother says. So looking around my neighborhood I spotted the familiar neon lights that spell "OPEN", a lighthouse that guides the hungry castaways to safety. 

When I got to the food truck I was greeted by a lovely Mexican couple offering traditional Veracruz food. Between Zacahuil and Huachinango I found myself charging like a mad bull at the Red chilaquiles. I ordered mine with beef and topped, like a crowning jewel, with a fried egg.  

A moment of silence ensued while I waited for my food, so I flipped open the entrance stone to the world of Kafka by the Shore. Within this realm there's an absence of time which casts an uncanny grip on me, reminiscent of Juan Rulfo's Pedro Paramo. Dead people appear to be alive, alter egos manifest as crows and cats provide helpful tips - if you know how to talk to them. 

While reading I admire the way Murakami writes, it's as if I am following Kafka Tamura through the forest, giving in to the unknown and being guided by the two dead World War soldiers. After a rigorous trek they reach another dimension and the soldiers warn Kafka, letting him known that if he's not careful he could remain there forever. 

This place seemed like it was built on nostalgia. The greek

nostalgia, the pain from an old wound. It represents an emotional anchor to that which is familiar, its known. We prefer to continue suffering instead of giving in to the unknown, granting forgivness to ourselves or our transgressors. 

Kafka Tamura describes this place 

The mirage of dead ideal, a long lost place. You can find comfort here, but if you stay too long you'll make the old pain real. 


After a couple of minutes of reading, my transce is broken by the welcoming sight of my red chilaquiles a beautiful manifestation of Mexican cuisine. The fried tortillas smothered in red salsa had the perfect consistency, some parts crunchy, others soft, carrying the the vessel of flavor to my mouth. 

**maybe finish with letting go of the safety, known and venture forth to the uknown, that's where discoveries happen. Have you alter ego remind yourself to be strong**

There are parts of this book that force you to let go of what is known and accept the unknown. Just like Kafka Tamura had to do when he was driven by his impulse to discover what's within the forest in the mountains. 


Between the struggles of a run away kid and the friendship of a truck driver and an old quirky guy that talks to cats, I find myself with more questions than answers. 

and just venture forth. I think how Kafka Tamura, driven by his impulse to discover what's inside the forest had to let go of his bag, compass and hatchet
