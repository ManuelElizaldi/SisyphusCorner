I hear people want freedom, but as I wake up this Saturday morning, not having to work and with the whole day ahead of me, I feel somewhat anxious not knowing what to do with all this free time. Filled with spontaneity any impulse can decide my next step, so needing my daily dose of caffeine, I make myself my morning coffee on my espresso machine. 

I am using a roast from the land of the Kilimanjaro - Tanzania. I bought this bag of beans in the capital of Barbecue, Lockhart, Texas at Chaparral coffee shop. The bag features a road runner and the phrase "Be Good to Your Neighbors". Drinking the coffee I taste some smokey caramel that soothes my urge to be caffeinated. 

After the morning ritual of energizing myself is dealt with, I then take a cold shower, a juxtaposition from the warmth of my americano. I decide to wear my faded black wranglers, my "Yo si subi el Teposteco" UFO t-shirt and put on my sandals to venture off to satisfy my next impulse, the most human sensation: hunger

My craving for the pastrami sandwich with perfectly smoked fatty meat, hugged by a buttery toasted bread and paired with lettuce and tomatoes that pierce through meat like a honed katana, propels me to the deli shop behind my apartment. I was driven by purse impulse, so I forgot to check the opening hours. To my dismay, the restaurant was closed. 

An important rule to which everyone should live by is to know that there is always another option, or at least, that's what my mother says. So looking around my neighborhood I spotted the familiar neon lights that spell "OPEN", a lighthouse that guides the hungry castaways to safety. 

When I got to the food truck I was greeted by a lovely couple of Jarochos offering traditional Veracruz food. Between Zacahuil and Huachinango I found myself charging like a mad bull at the Red chilaquiles. I ordered mine with beef and an extra fried egg. 

A moment of silence ensued while I waited for my food, so I flipped open the entrance stone to the world of Kafka by the Shore. Within this realm there's an absence of time which casts an uncanny grip on me, reminiscent of Juan Rulfo's Pedro Paramo. Dead people appear to be alive, alter egos manifest as crows and cats provide helpful tips, if you know how to talk to them. 

While reading I admire the way Murakami writes, it's as if I am following Kafka Tamura through the forest, guided by two dead World War II soldiers, stepping in to the unknown. After a rigorous trek these characters reach another dimension and the soldiers warn Kafka letting him known that if he's not careful, he could remain there forever. 

By Kafka Tamaura's description of this place I get the impression that this alternate reality is built on nostalgia. It evokes a familiar warmth provided by a forest cabin that looks similar to the one Oshima lends Kafka in the real world. But strangely, this version doesn't feel right somehow it's similar but eerie.

Somewhere along the road I learned that nostalgia means the pain from an old wound. This can act as a delicate, but potent emotional anchor that keeps us living in the past, a place that seems familiar but is hollow. It gives a false sense of safety by allowing us to live stuck in our ways, giving in to what we already known and rendering useless any power we can exercise on our life. 

Holding on to this anchor 

It can become easy to live in the past stuck in your ways. Kafka kept believing in the curse set by his father and perpetuating the anger he felt by the abandonment of his mother. We prefer to continue suffering, holding on to what we think is real, the mirage of a dead ideal, but in reality this is an empty place that can't withstand the pressures to build a life.

By giving in to the unknown we grant ourselves or our transgressors forgiveness. We rid ourselves of the curse set by life's circumstances. 


After a couple of minutes of reading, my trance is broken by the welcoming sight of my red chilaquiles, a beautiful manifestation of Mexican cuisine. The fried tortillas smothered in red salsa had the perfect consistency, some parts crunchy, others soft, carrying the the vessel of spicy flavor to my mouth and to top it all of, the crowning jewel of a fried egg.

Between the struggles of a run away kid and the friendship of a truck driver and an old quirky guy that talks to cats, I find myself with more questions than answers while reading Kafka by the Shore, but maybe that was Murakami's intention when writing this book. An invitation to venture forth to the unknown.
