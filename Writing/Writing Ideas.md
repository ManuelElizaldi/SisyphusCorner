What is it about old things that makes me love them and want to keep them forever? + On nostalgia?

~~Don't let ideas fly away, once gone they will have no place to grow. I was watching mad men and this scene where a creative has the perfect idea for an ad. He was so drunk that he forgot to write it, it was poetic how he refered to the idea flying away. Who hasn't been through that? I want to write something about this feeling. The struggle of having something precious in your hands and then it just goes away.~~ 
- ~~This might be related in some way but I think the song "waiting on a song is related to this feeling"~~
- ~~capture God's whispers <- this could be the title~~

### love letter

### Story
- Story about expedition in space ship, the AI is connected to the mind of the main engineer so it can troubleshoot issues easier. He goes crazy *sci-fi*

-2 characters, both journalists from Mexico. One from Nuevo Laredo and the other one from Mexico City. The character in Mexico City can be a super commuter, spends most of his day on the public transport. The one from Nuevo Laredo has a simple but arduous life, very monotonous, everything is repeated so much that time almost seams to be blurred. The social experience is different from each other, but it often feels like something. <- This is the idea

The scholar - I have some notes on my notebook 


### Currently working on:
- ~~Books that helped me in my career *technical*~~
- MY AI experiment - Learning Game Development

"I been saying this for a couple years now. I first noticed it with the remake of GoW1. Games are too focused on looking pretty that they surrender their unique ambiance aesthetic. Most games go for pretty when instead they should aim to design their own style. Think about the gritty ambiance of GoW, the edge of Jet Set Radio or Halo CE's purple, chrome, clearer skies."
