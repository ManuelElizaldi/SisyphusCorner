### Notes on Writing
Remember to use voice memos
Set a time for review idea list - once a week. Its okay to cross out ideas that you are no longer excited about. 

Idea template:
**Title or Hook** (one sentence or phrase)  
→ What would grab attention? (example: "Espresso Bars: The Last Romantic Places")

**Key Feeling or Theme** (one word or phrase)  
→ What emotion or idea do you want to convey? (example: "nostalgia", "grit", "playfulness")

**One Line of Expansion** (optional)  
→ What’s one thought you might explore? (example: "The scent of fresh coffee feels like a daily ritual of hope.")
