Important commands I have used so far :

- npx create-next-app@latest my-app (1)
- npm run dev (2)

<u>Terms I need to research/breakdown</u>
- [ ] avahi-daemon 
- [ ] mDNS (Multicast DNS) and DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery
- [ ] npx create-next-app@latest my-app
- [ ] npm run dev
- [ ] Bonjour Print Services

After creating the app with command (1), and then doing (2), I can enter http://100.64.136.37:3000/ into my web browser and see the web app 
	note: the guy on the video I am following used raspberrypi.local:3000 instead of the IP address.
