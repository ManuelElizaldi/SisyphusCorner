	- Breakdown of this command requiered
- npm run dev
	- Breakdown of this command requiered

After creating the app with command (1), and then doing (2), I can enter http://100.64.136.37:3000/ into my web browser and see the web app 
	note: the guy on the video I am following used raspberrypi.local:3000 instead of the IP address.
