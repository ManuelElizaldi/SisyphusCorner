Search engine is a system that helps users find information. 

Search engines perform:
- Collecting Data - web crawling or indexing documents
- Organize Data - Storing it effectively for fast retrieval 
- Retrieving Data - Based on user queries, search the data
- Ranking Results - Sorting the result of the query based on relevance and other variables

Examples:
Google, Bing -> search the web
Elasticsearch -> search within app or database
Youtube, spotify -> search for videos or music within their database/library

*I write these examples because, previously, I believed search engines were only for the internet*
