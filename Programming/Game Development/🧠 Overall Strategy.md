Game Development Learning Path

You‚Äôre learning video game development as a dual goal:

1. **Grow technical skills** (with a possible long-term goal of building a game engine)
    
2. **Build psychological resilience** (overcoming self-doubt, overwhelm, and project drop-off)

## üß± **Momentum Safeguards (Psychological Strategy)**

- **Overwhelm** ‚Üí Break tasks down further if needed
    
- **Self-Doubt** ‚Üí Write down one new thing you understand after each session
    
- **Hitting a Wall** ‚Üí Switch the mode: ask for help, watch a video, or try a smaller challenge
    
- Optional Trello ‚ÄúWall Breakers‚Äù column for tasks you‚Äôll revisit when ready
    

### üîë Core Principles Behind the Plan:

- **Sustainable effort**: 2‚Äì3 hours/week, split into 2‚Äì3 small tasks
    
- **Mental momentum**: Reflect on progress weekly to counteract insecurity and burnout
    
- **Start simple, build confidence**: Begin with raw fundamentals using Pygame
    
- **Trello** used to visually track tasks and progress
# Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1‚Äì4)

Focus: Learning the core elements of game development in Python with Pygame. Goal: Gain a solid understanding of game loops, object movement, input handling, and basic game physics.

## Week 1: Game Window & Drawing

Goal: Set up Pygame, create a window, and draw basic objects.  
Tasks:  
- Install Pygame.  
- Create a simple game window that opens and closes properly.  
- Draw a rectangle (or other basic shapes) on the screen.  
Reflection:  
- What was easy?  
- What was confusing or difficult?  
- One thing you‚Äôre proud of completing.

## Week 2: Bouncing Ball Project

Goal: Implement ball movement and bouncing using screen boundaries.  
Tasks:  
- Create a ball with position and velocity variables.  
- Animate the ball‚Äôs movement.  
- Make the ball bounce off the edges of the screen.  
Reflection:  
- What new thing did you learn about Pygame?  
- Was there a moment of self-doubt? How did you overcome it?  
- How did the ball bouncing come together technically?

## Week 3: Improving the Bouncing Ball or Starting New Task

Goal: Enhance the bouncing ball project (add new features), or start a new project to keep the momentum.  
Tasks (Option 1):  
- Add new features to the bouncing ball project:  
¬† - Add random speeds, change color on bounce, or add keyboard input.  
¬† - Refactor the code to make it more modular (e.g., using functions).  
OR  
Tasks (Option 2):  
- Start a new micro-project:  
¬† - E.g., Create a basic 'Catch the Falling Object' game where you control a character at the bottom of the screen using the keyboard to catch falling objects.  
Reflection:  
- What was your thought process for adding these new features or starting a new project?  
- What worked well? What did you struggle with?  
- How are you feeling about your ability to finish tasks?

# Phase 2: Core Skills (Weeks 5‚Äì8)

Focus: Developing more complex game systems, improving code organization, and adding interactivity.

## Week 4: Input Handling and Movement

Goal: Learn to capture keyboard and mouse input to control objects in the game.  
Tasks:  
- Use `pygame.event.get()` to capture keyboard inputs.  
- Move objects on screen using keyboard keys.  
- Implement basic mouse controls (e.g., click to spawn objects).  
Reflection:  
- What new skills did you develop by handling input?  
- Did you feel more confident with Pygame‚Äôs event loop?  
- What would you improve for next time?

## Week 5: Basic Game Physics

Goal: Introduce basic physics (e.g., gravity, velocity).  
Tasks:  
- Implement gravity that affects a falling object.  
- Create a simple 'jump' mechanic for a player-controlled object.  
- Use a gravity constant and apply it over time to affect velocity.  
Reflection:  
- How did you solve issues with physics (like objects falling too fast)?  
- Was implementing gravity as challenging as you expected?  
- Did you break the task down to manageable chunks?

## Week 6: Sound and Music

Goal: Add sound effects and music to your games to enhance the experience.  
Tasks:  
- Use `pygame.mixer` to load and play sounds (e.g., a sound when an object bounces).  
- Add background music that plays throughout the game.  
Reflection:  
- What challenges did you face in adding sound/music?  
- How did you debug or troubleshoot any audio issues?  
- How did sound improve your game‚Äôs experience?

## Week 7: Start Organizing Code with Classes

Goal: Learn to use object-oriented programming (OOP) to better organize your game code.  
Tasks:  
- Create a `Player` class for game objects.  
- Define movement and collision behavior inside the class.  
- Use instances of your class to represent different characters or objects.  
Reflection:  
- How does using classes improve code organization?  
- What are the pros and cons of OOP for game development?  
- Which part of using classes felt challenging?

## Week 8: Finish a Mini-Game Project

Goal: Combine everything you‚Äôve learned into a small, playable game.  
Tasks:  
- Create a simple playable game (e.g., Pong, Breakout, or a basic platformer).  
- Implement scoring, collision, input handling, and basic physics.  
Reflection:  
- How do you feel about completing a full game?  
- What did you learn about making a game from start to finish?  
- What would you improve if you had more time?

# Phase 3: Refining and Expanding (Weeks 9‚Äì12)

Focus: Polish existing games, add more complex mechanics, or start transitioning to an engine like Godot.

## Week 9: Game Refinement and Polishing

Goal: Polish your game‚Äôs mechanics, fix bugs, and improve the overall feel.  
Tasks:  
- Add new levels, improve the UI, or enhance gameplay mechanics.  
- Fix any bugs that arose during testing.  
Reflection:  
- What did you improve? What was the most satisfying change you made?  
- Did you find it easier or harder to test and debug the game?

## Week 10: Transition to Game Engine (Optional)

Goal: Start experimenting with a more complex game engine like Godot, Unity, or Unreal, or dive deeper into your Python games.  
Tasks:  
- If transitioning to Godot, create a basic project in Godot and learn the interface.  
- If staying with Pygame, start learning advanced Pygame features like animations or integrating external libraries.  
Reflection:  
- What‚Äôs different about using a full game engine versus Pygame?  
- How do you feel about your skills now‚Äîare you ready to tackle larger games?

## Week 11‚Äì12: Start a New Game or Engine Project

Goal: Begin your next game or engine-based project, using everything you‚Äôve learned.  
Tasks:  
- Design and start working on a larger game or experiment with features in a new game engine.  
Reflection:  
- What‚Äôs your long-term goal now? What would you like to focus on next?

# Key Takeaways

Mindset: Learning is incremental. Don‚Äôt rush; celebrate small victories. Reflect each week to stay motivated.  
Pacing: Work on 2‚Äì3 tasks per week, and feel free to adjust if you encounter difficulties. Don‚Äôt let perfectionism stop you from completing tasks.  
Resilience: When self-doubt arises, focus on progress, not perfection. Take breaks, and ask for help when needed.

# Next Steps

At the end of Week 2, we‚Äôll check in, reflect, and decide what you want to work on next, based on your progress and how you're feeling about the challenges you've tackled so far.
