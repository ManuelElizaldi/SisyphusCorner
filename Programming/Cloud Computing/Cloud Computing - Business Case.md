#### SWOT Analysis
- Strength: Low cost, low upfront time, no maintenance/upgrades, risk sharing, secure, flexible
	- option to abandon without sunk cost -> you don't need to buy thousands of computers. If your project does not work in the future you can just stop the cloud service.
	- Important: CAPEX vs OPEX -> Capital Expenditure is a spike, not predictable, OPEX is more predictable, CFO prefer having OPEX

- Weakness: 
	- Managing spending -> There are so many options, resources, etc. that you could have a system online and forget about it. You might have infrastructure that you are not using
	- Governance and control -> you lose some control over how
	-
