### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service 
The physical aspect of a computer is managed by someone, when you need it you rent it via the internet and you get a virtual machine.

- highly scalable, if you needed 100 computer for tomorrow you could rent it

### PaaS - Platform as a Service

Give me a computer with all the libraries necessary to do the work. Example: I just want to log in into the computer and start programming.
- Google App Engine
- Heroku 

This service offers a platform 

### SaaS - Software as a Service
You don't need anything to use the software. Of course, you have a lot less control and customizability. You don't need computers, servers, etc.
Example: Gmail

The more right you move (Iaas -> SaaS) you stop relying on infrastructure and people, but you also lose some control.

#### SWOT Analysis - Internal
- Strength: Low cost, low upfront time, no maintenance/upgrades, risk sharing, secure, flexible
	- option to abandon without sunk cost -> you don't need to buy thousands of computers. If your project does not work in the future you can just stop the cloud service.
	- Important: CAPEX vs OPEX -> Capital Expenditure is a spike, not predictable, OPEX is more predictable, CFO prefer having OPEX

- Weakness: Integration of multiple cloud systems and with internal system still evolving
	- Managing spending -> There are so many options, resources, etc. that you could have a system online and forget about it. You might have infrastructure that you are not using
	- Governance and control -> Outsourcing reduces control. 
	- Data resides remotely -> There is some degree of fear of having sensitive data living somewhere outside of our control.
		- It is very unlikely that you will be robbed, but the fear is still there.
	- Limited customization -> you are only able to choose what the cloud offers.
	- Long run ROI unsure -> Example: owning your own machine for 2 years vs using the cloud
		- I feel like this depends on the company

#### SWOT Analysis - External
- Opportunities:
	- Cloud integration -> different apps can integrate easily to the cloud
	- Enterprise systems can be on the cloud
	- Analytics on the cloud 
	- New technologies are being developed 
- Threats 
	- Compliance and regulation -> safety of data 
	- Cybersecurity 
	- Weak identity and access management -> its easier to hack a password than to steal local machines


Regarding security -> If you are a large company with the capacity to hire specialized security, the question arise that if its worth it to get cloud services
