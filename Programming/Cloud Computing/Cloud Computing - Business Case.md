Cloud computing allows division of labor.

#### SWOT Analysis
- Strength: Low cost, low upfront time, no maintenance/upgrades, risk sharing, secure, flexible
	- option to abandon without sunk cost -> you don't need to buy thousands of computers. If your project does not work in the future you can just stop the cloud service.
	- Important: CAPEX vs OPEX -> Capital Expenditure is a spike, not predictable, OPEX is more predictable, CFO prefer having OPEX

- Weakness: Integration of multiple cloud systems and with internal system still evolving
	- Managing spending -> There are so many options, resources, etc. that you could have a system online and forget about it. You might have infrastructure that you are not using
	- Governance and control -> Outsourcing reduces control. 
	- Data resides remotely -> There is some degree of fear of having sensitive data living somewhere outside of our control.
		- It is very unlikely that you will be robbed, but the fear is still there.
	- Limited customization -> you are only able to choose what the cloud offers.
	- Long run ROI unsure -> Example: owning your own machine for 2 years vs using the cloud
		- I feel like this depends on the company
