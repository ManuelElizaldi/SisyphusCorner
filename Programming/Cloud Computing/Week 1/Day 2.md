# Cloud Attributes, Managed Services & Deployment Models

## Cloud Computing Attributes

Choice of provider -> do a *fitment analysis* -> refers to the process of assessing and determining the suitability or compatibility of something for a specific role.

You have to analyze your organization and determine which is the best for you

Agility, OnDemand, Self Service -> is the cloud service available on your region? What about agility -> speed is hugely important on today's operations. 

- Look for the *Turn around time* -> total time taken to complete a task, the goal is to reduce this 

- Self service -> not depending on other departments

Resource pooling -> Leverage economies of scale for cost reduction. Attribute that involves the aggregation and sharing of computing resources to serve multiple customers. 
- Economies of scale -> refers to the cost advantages that a business can achieve as it increases its production or scale of operation. 
	- If you have multiple clients you can spread the risk across them all
	- This motivates customers to grow

Admin and monitoring -> Being proactive is better than reactive. Constant monitoring of the infrastructure. 
- The cloud offers tools to monitor, but you still have to go out and do the work

Core data center services -> the building, security, electricity, all the infrastructure needed to hold the cloud hardware

Managed services -> Hosted managed services allow developers to focus on core applications with business logic, support services become an API call. 
- The enterprise has to worry about many things, networking portals, data base centers, hardware, middleware, etc. so the cloud comes in and offers all these as a managed service
- The business can focus on the product 

Resilience, Elastic and Subscription ->  Building infrastructure that can sustain failures. 

## Cloud Offerings/Cloud Managed Services

Team of services -> the different offerings of a cloud provider

All of them will provide elastic infrastructure 

*Node availability* -> if one computer fails, is there another instance that can take over the operation

*Hadoop* -> cluster computing for big data

*MapReduce* -> operation used by cloud services to process data within the cloud operation 

Ephemeral Storage -> it lasts the duration of the session/operation

When you build a big data database, it is very complex, so the cloud comes in and offers a system to help you set everything up

Cassandra -> NoSQL database management system designed for high scalability and fault tolerance

Connectivity -> When you have multiple apps in an operation you need to find a way to connect them all. *ESB* Enterprise service bus 
- Apache ActiveMQ -> open source solution that facilitates the exchange of data between distributed applications. 
	- Clouds can offer something similar or that software
