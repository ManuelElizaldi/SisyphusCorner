# Definitions, Stories & Business Concerns

There is no such thing as Cloud Computing -> its only someone else computer/data center *kind of saying this jokingly*

## Services

*Infrastructure* -> give you compute, networking and storage.
- AWS, Google, Microsoft Azure 

*Platform Vendors* -> Abstracts things you need to be responsible of, software updates, packages, etc. 

*Software as a service* -> broad definition. Apps, APIs, etc. You are producing something and someone else is consuming it. The consumer does not care about infrastructure or platform, he just wants the app/product. 

*System Integrators* -> Person or organization that focuses on making different software and hardware work together in a cohesive and functional system. This can become a complex technological system
- Building the cloud system 

## Why Cloud Computing - Is it for me?

Why cloud computing -> capital expenditure to operational expenditure

Cloud Computing is not for everyone, you have to evaluate the technological landscape of your organization. Sometimes its not worth the investment

*Big Bang Transition* -> moving the entire IT infrastructure of a company in one big significant move. Typically replacing the on-premise system entirely
- Usually this strategy does not work 

### Capacity Planning 

Determining the optimal resources, including hardware, software and network infrastructure, required to meet the current and future demands while maintaining cost-efficiency and performance

### Stories

World of Warcraft not having enough servers 

Instagram outages 

Flipkart - Indian retailer, billion day sale. Sometimes in high demand days, the servers are not ready for that spike in demand 

note:
ASP -> Application Service Provider in early 2000s, this term evolved into SaaS. 

_ASP_ was also a company popular in the early 2000s, that offered a place to keep all your hardware. They would take care of it and you could log in from your enterprise via the network. They offered primary power supply, secondary power and networking. They made sure everything was running. This was a primitive version of IaaS

_SETI@HOME_ -> Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence at home, software that allowed you to download audio recording from space to search for meaningful information. Mid 90s
- So, is distributed computing a cloud invention? It is not. It's been around for some time now 

_Distributed computing_: Involves a network of interconnected computers collaborating to tackle problems 

### What does Enterprise worry about

Service availability -> I want my end user to be able to consume my product.
- User growth is hard to determine. 

_Elasticity_ -> Elasticity is the automatic adaption and allocation of computing resources like servers and storage to match fluctuating workloads and needs. 
- This ensures cost-efficiency and performance scaling

_Virtualization_ -> Technology that enables multiple virtual instances of operating systems, servers or networks to run on a single physical hardware system. 

_Redundancy_ -> Duplicates servers, storage and network infrastructure to ensure seamless operation and resilience against failures. Minimizing data loss 
- Very important and basic. All data centers need something like this
- Preferably, you create this in different geographies 

_IT refresh_ -> 3 year life span for hardware. Every 3 years you get new hardware. 
- Do you want to do this every 3 years? As an enterprise you need to take this into consideration. Businesses rather focus on their main objective/product

_Lock-in_ -> When a customer becomes too dependent on one cloud service ecosystem, making it difficult and costly to switch
