Managed service - Abstracts the complexity of deploying and maintaining services. 
core -> you keep inside your organization. You own it. It has to do with the main purpose of your organization. 

Managed -> services are taken care by a third party, but are still under the ownership of the company

outsourced -> You let someone else take care of the whole service/operation. You sacrifice some control over the process.  

##### Challenge
For companies, one of the main challenges is change. Managed services helps addressing this. 

We live in an era of impatience - you need to develop your app to be fast. 
- sub-second loading 

*Security Management* - your core business process is not security, therefore you are no aware of your vulnerabilities and how to address them. 
- "You don't know how much you don't know"
- "The fortress is opened from within"

You wont be able to spend money and time in security. It is better to outsource this and let someone manage this.

Serverless - it doesn't mean it does not need a server, it only means that it does not run on a EC2 instance. 

### Important considerations when building an Instance DB
Engine 

Free tier

Single AZ instance 

Connect to a EC2 instance 

### To connect to the DB instance
you need the end point, you need to install mysql (or the engine you chose in the EC2 instance you are using to connect to the RD)

End point is inside the details of your DB instance

Also depending on your sql engine, the port might change
- make sure your inbound security group for the *EC2* is open this port

This is the CLI command:

You can run python or java code to run commands on your database 
- use tools like mysql connector and other libraries 

If you delete a db you can keep any snapshots you took

## SQS 

Queue management - secures your transactions 
- orders are kept
