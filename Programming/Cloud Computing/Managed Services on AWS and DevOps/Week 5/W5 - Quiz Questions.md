Analyze the following escalation email from your customer.

_**Subject: Escalation of Feature Release Velocity**_

Dear John Doe,

I am writing to escalate the issue of the feature release velocity of the application. We have released a number of features over the past few months, but the velocity of these releases has been too slow to meet our goals.

The current velocity of feature releases is not acceptable and needs to be improved. We need to create a plan to increase the speed of feature releases, and ensure that this plan is implemented as soon as possible.

We need to ensure that we are able to deliver features to our users in a timely manner. We need to review our processes and identify areas for improvement. We also need to ensure that we are able to allocate the resources needed to meet our goals.

I appreciate your help in this matter. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe

**You have a customer who has built a unique algorithm that works on highly sensitive data. All this is being hosted on the customer's own data centre. In this scenario, is it advisable for the customer to host the algorithm's code on a cloud-based Git repository? Assume none of the customer's IT systems is on the cloud.**
No, maintain the code in the customer's data centred
The customer seems to be in a highly classified business area and it may be better to take a more defensive approach of managing everything in-house.
