[[Container Orchestration]] [[Container]]

Docker file is used to containerize an application

### Typical development pipeline
code -> deployed to code repo (git hub) -> you compile it with CI (Jenkins or git lab) -> CD continuous deployment tools (harness/UCD) -> SDLC testing and load testing -> Production

### Docker
Docker -> image repo (AWS ECR, docker hub) -> CD -> dev, test, prod 

### Deployment environment 
Host 1 -> app 1, app 2, app 3

To avoid having 1 point of failure, we add another host:

Host 2 -> app 1, app 2, app 3 

#### You can also add a disaster recovery set up
dev, test, prod -> inside your disaster recovery set up

#### After having all of these environments - VMs how do you maintain all containers organized?
How do you know what is running what? Spreadsheets are not scalable so we use **container orchestration**

# Container Orchestration
automating the networking and management of containers 

You have to be able to scale your containers, run many containerized applications, running versions, integration with CI/CD

## How does container orchestration work?

Cluster = logical container made up of multiple hosts
