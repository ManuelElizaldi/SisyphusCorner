Projects around data - data modeling, processing, ETL, ELT

## Block vs Object
Block -> every disk, it stores data as blocks HD, SSD, etc. It can sit on memory so it is really fast. 
- How big are the blocks? -> This is determined when you set up the OS. 
- Scaling this can be hard if you are dealing with data objects

That's why there's Object Storage -> It stores data as a json, like MongoDB and DynamoDB (also known as NoSQL databases)

## Data Lakes
Data source -> Data lake - Data in raw format -> Data Transforms -> goes into Data Mart or Data Warehouse 

Today they only do a data dump, they don't tell you about schemas

Data as a Service -> companies that produce a lot of data and want to understand it go to companies that offer data as a service. 
- Eliminates guesswork
