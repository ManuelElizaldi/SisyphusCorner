**A company is planning to launch a new application that will require a complex, multi-tier cloud infrastructure. The company wants to quickly create and deploy the necessary infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation. The company begins by creating a template that specifies all the resources and their configurations that will be required. This includes AWS EC2 instances, security groups, an ELB, a database instance, an S3 bucket and IAM roles.**

**The company then uses the CloudFormation template to create a stack. This stack creates all the necessary resources and configures them as specified in the template.**

**Once the stack is created, the company can deploy the application to the EC2 instances in the stack. The ELB will automatically distribute traffic across the instances, while the RDS instance provides the necessary database. The IAM roles and security groups are configured to provide secure access to the application and resources.**

**Finally, the S3 bucket is used to store any data associated with the application.**

**By using AWS CloudFormation, the company is able to achieve which of the following?**
Quickly and easily create, deploy and manage its complex cloud infrastructure
Document the required infrastructure along with dependencies
Focus more on the application and business features needed by the customers
