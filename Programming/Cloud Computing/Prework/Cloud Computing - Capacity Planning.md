When you start a project, there are a lot of questions you need to ask? Do you hire 10 people or 15? Do you buy 1 computer or 5? etc.

You have to calculate what is your capacity. Determine the demand trend, and based on that decide on capacity.

Sometimes you don't know demand and you have to chose the capacity upfront

Cloud computing can create computers on the fly, on demand. So you can mirror the demand:
- Blue line being your capacity

*The computer need is synchronous*, meaning: If you want to send an email or refresh a browser, it needs to respond at that moment. But there are other industries where the need is not synchronous

For example an *asynchronous computational need*: If you are making a huge calculation, for example an economic model, you can leave the computer running and come back to it later.  
- Bioinformatics is another examples where calculations are extremely complicated. 

The cloud services can satisfy both types of needs.

So, the cloud computing service can offer both asynchronous and synchronous service. That way no capacity is lost, and both markets can satisfy their needs paying the right cost, because the existence of one, justifies the other.
