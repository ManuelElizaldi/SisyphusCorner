Tips from a graduate -> 

#### Subrat Muruni 
Senior System Analyst at Visa

20 years of experience and decided to study this course because technology is evolving and he wanted to solidify his foundations

##### Be consistent 

- Read all the material. Consume it in byte sizes, plan your weekend ahead of time. There are videos that are 10 mins or 1 hour. You need to be able to reflect on the content, so take it slow. 

- Create a study group, focus on building community 
- Assist all meetings  

- Bring quality questions to the TA meetings, don't bring trivial questions. For that use the ticket system.
- Research/think about what's the next step after the course, ask your mentors for their professional experience. Read blogs, youtube videos, etc.
