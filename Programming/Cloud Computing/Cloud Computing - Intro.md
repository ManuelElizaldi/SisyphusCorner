### Cloud Computing
On demand araciality of computing system resources, especially like *storage* and *computing power* 
- Think about it as using someone else's computer via the internet
### Initial steps to cloud computing
2006 -> Amazon creates [[Elastic Computer Cloud 2]] or EC2, this could be considered the first cloud computer 

Client Server -> You own a computer (thin client) and contact another more powerful computer
- The downside is that if the server computer goes down, it brings everything down. 

Then they realized they could connect a bunch of computers together.

### Virtualization software

On demand virtualization -> there's a whole series of computers capable of creating virtual versions of physical hardware like servers, storage or networks. 

You essentially have multiple VMs (virtual machines) running on a single physical machine, each operating as an independent machine
