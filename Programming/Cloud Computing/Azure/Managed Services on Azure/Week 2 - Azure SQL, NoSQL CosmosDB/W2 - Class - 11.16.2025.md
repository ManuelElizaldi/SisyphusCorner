# NoSQL
Where to use NoSQL -> social media, unstructured, all the data produced by automated cars can be stored in a NoSQL

Managed instance -> The infrastructure is updated, patched and maintained for you. You run the newest version of the database. 

# Azure SQL DB

# Elastic Pool
This is used for scaling. If you notice that the use of your database goes up and down and you don't need a database constantly running you can use this. 

How it works -> You share your compute power with other users. Azure handles this. 
- Similar to how you share spot instances. 
- **The professor did not recommend using this in production**
