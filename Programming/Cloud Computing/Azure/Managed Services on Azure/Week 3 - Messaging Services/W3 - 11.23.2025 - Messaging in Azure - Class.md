# Messaging in Azure
Event Hub -> High throughput 

Queue storage -> First in first out is supported but not guaranteed

## Storage 
When you create a storage account, a container (not docker) is created under the hood. This is the equivalent to *bucket* in AWS. 

Under each storage account you get 3 more options -> file share, queue, tables. 

- File share -> file system
- Queues -> messaging 
- Tables -> Databases 

The above are services inside storage.

### Storage queues 
This service does not cost until you start using it. It has FIFO, but not guaranteed. 

### Service Bus
Higher throughput, offering dead letter queue, transaction support, FIFO.

### ADLs 
In storage account you can enable hierarchy name space, you can organize data based on characteristics 

### Azure Blueprints
Automate the delivery of governance, policies so that your organization is compliant with policies. 
- Same as template but for rules 

### Event Bridge & Event Processing
Events happen in a resource (publisher) -> sends it to event grid -> send it to the vent handlers = there is a resulting action. 

Event hub is great for very high throughput 

**For example -> Off shore drilling company, devices attached to vehicles that gather information to then be processed by event hub. **

Dev ops job requirement -> Learning terraform
