# Creating a Vnet Peering
Connect networks between 2 clouds. Resources in each cloud can connect/ talk to each other through private IPs

> [!NOTE] When doing Vnet to Vnet connection
> You need to establish a connection between two VPN Gateways. So you need to deploy this two resources in each cloud to create the connection. 
> Vnet Peering does not require 2 VPN gateways. 

All traffic flows through the backbone network but all traffic is unencrypted.
