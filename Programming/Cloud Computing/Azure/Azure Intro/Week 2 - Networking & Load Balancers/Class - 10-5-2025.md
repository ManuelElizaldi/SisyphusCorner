## Load Balancer

Application load balancer -> TCP protocol HTTPs
network load balancer -> network protocols, manages IPs but can also take in TCP 

### Internal balancer vs public balancer
Internal load balancing -> balances traffic inside the Vnet between your resources

Public load balancer has a public IP so external traffic can reach it

### Nat Gateway
We create a NAT Gateway to ensure our VMs are not exposed to the internet. It gives us additional security.

In this set up we are careful no to apply a *public IP* to the VM 

### Bastion Host
When creating a Vnet you enable if you want an *Azure Bastion* which acts as a bastion host 

### Creating Load Balancer 
Front end IP = public IP. This IP is what public traffic will hit

#### Session Affinity 
Users are always distributed to the same VM 

#### Azure Monitor = AWS CloudWatch 

## Vnet Peering
Vnet peering also works between subscriptions and a mesh network is created

## End points
Access cloud services securely without going through the internet. For example if you want to access a database securely from your VM, you create an end point. 

- Service end point -> attached to a particular service. 
- Private link
