[[Science]], [[Neural Networks]]

Eyes turn light into electricity inside the retina (photoreceptor cells - rods and cones), this electricity is captures by the neurons, specifically the dendritic spines in the dendrites. The input (electricity) travels to the axon and then send to another neuron. 

The neurons receive an input, send a signal and depending on the combination of signals the neural network decides what the input was. <-  Neural networks work like that

Rods - low light capturing.
Cones - color vision and visual acuity (sharpness or clarity), distinguishing fine details. 

[[Personal Idea]]
**We feel by electricity, we think because of electricity. We are 70% water, a great conductor of electricity**
